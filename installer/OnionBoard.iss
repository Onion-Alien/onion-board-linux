; OnionBoardSetup.exe: one file a non-technical person double-clicks on a fresh PC.
;
;   - no Python needed: it ships the PyInstaller build (dist\OnionBoard)
;   - no admin needed for the app itself (installs per user, like Discord does)
;   - a "Your privacy" page (PrivacyPage in [Code], before the checkboxes): in plain
;     words, what the app connects to and when, what the Tor box does, and a link to
;     SECURITY.md#what-the-app-does-on-the-network. Its "Offline mode" box (unticked;
;     ticked already when the app is in Offline mode) runs OnionBoard.exe --set-offline
;     before anything else runs, so the app never goes online, not even on its first
;     start, and unticks the boxes below that download things (they can be ticked
;     again: the installer downloads those, the app stays offline; Tor is skipped,
;     since the app never starts it while offline)
;   - a "Pick what you want" page of checkboxes:
;       * the free VB-Cable virtual cable (downloaded from vb-audio.com,
;         signature-checked by install-vbcable.ps1; Windows asks "Yes" once)
;       * FFmpeg for m4a / aac / video files (via winget; hidden when ffmpeg is
;         already there or winget isn't)
;       * the add-on modules in ..\modules (retro voice effect, live voice-to-speech)
;       * Tor, unticked: the installer doesn't carry it. A ticked box runs
;         OnionBoard.exe --get-tor, which downloads the Tor Project's Expert Bundle
;         (soundboard/torget.py: SHA-256 pinned, the saved proxy used) into
;         %APPDATA%\OnionBoard\tor\bin (Settings > Connection's "Get Tor" button does
;         the same). A failed download says so and leaves the app working without it
;       * Keep a history of network activity, unticked: runs OnionBoard.exe
;         --keep-netlog (config netlog_keep; soundboard/netlog.py keep())
;       * a Desktop shortcut
;   - a "Bring your sounds over" page (ImportPage in [Code]), only when another
;     soundboard's board is on this PC: Soundpad's %APPDATA%\Leppsoft\soundlist.spl,
;     Resanance's %APPDATA%\Resanance\data\Resanance.db, Soundux's
;     %APPDATA%\Soundux\config.json, EXP Soundboard's last board in the registry
;     (soundboard/otherboards.py). The last page before installing: a ticked box per
;     app found. Ticked ones are written to %APPDATA%\OnionBoard\import-from and the
;     app's first start copies the sounds in. Silent installs only do it for the apps
;     /IMPORT= names (comma-separated keys: soundpad,resanance,soundux,expboard):
;     nobody saw the boxes
;   - then opens Onion Board, whose Quick setup asks which mic they use and walks
;     them through Discord
;
; Silent installs (/VERYSILENT) use each box's default, or the choices from the
; last install. /OFFLINE=1 is the Offline mode box: it also skips the boxes that
; download (VB-Cable, FFmpeg, live voice, Tor) unless /TASKS= or /MERGETASKS= names
; them. Neither the box nor /OFFLINE ever switches Offline mode off: that's in the app.
; Compiled with /DPREVIEW it's a look at the import page only, for screenshots: every
; other page is skipped, all four apps are offered, and it can't install.
; Built by build.ps1 (needs Inno Setup 6: winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup).

WelcomeLabel1=Let's set up Onion Board
WelcomeLabel2=This puts Onion Board on your PC and can add the free "virtual cable", the pipe that lets Discord and your games hear your sounds (you can skip it if you'd rather send your sounds through Voicemeeter, a mixer or OBS).%n%nNext you'll see what it connects to online, then you can tick any extras you want. When Windows asks for permission, click Yes.%n%nDid Windows or your browser warn you before this opened ("Windows protected your PC", "not commonly downloaded")? That's normal for a free app that isn't code-signed, and you got past it fine. Next time: More info, then Run anyway.
WizardSelectTasks=Pick what you want
SelectTasksDesc=Tick what you'd like. If you're not sure, leave the boxes as they are.
FinishedHeadingLabel=All done!
FinishedLabel=Onion Board is installed. It will open now and ask you a few easy questions (which mic you use, where you listen, how your sounds reach Discord or your game).%n%nYou can find it later on your Desktop or in the Start menu.%n%nPrivacy: no account or ads. The only thing counted is the anonymous "still here" if you left Count me in ticked. Settings > Privacy & security shows everything the app does online, lets you switch those things off, and can send all of it through a proxy or Tor.
FinishedRestartLabel=Onion Board is installed. To finish setting up the virtual cable, Windows needs to restart your PC.%n%nAfter the restart, open Onion Board from the Start menu and it will pick up where it left off.
