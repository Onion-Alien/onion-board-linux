# Changelog

## 1.6.6 — 2026-10-04

- **Bring your board over from another soundboard.** Coming from Soundpad,
  Resanance, Soundux or EXP Soundboard? The installer spots it and offers a box,
  "Bring my sounds over from …"; leave it ticked and the first start copies your
  sounds in with their names, categories (tabs) and hotkeys. Your old app keeps its
  own copies and nothing of it is changed. Already installed: **Backup → Import from
  another soundboard**, the button in the setup guide, or drop its saved board file
  (a Soundpad `.spl`, for one) on the window. Sounds already on your board are
  skipped, and a hotkey something here already uses is left off. Nothing is looked
  at until you tick the box or click Import.
- **Quitting no longer crashes with Onion Watch watching:** closing the app with the
  Triggers tab watching could end in a Windows "stopped working" report after
  everything was already saved. It now ends cleanly.
- **The Triggers tab counts every trigger:** with more than 50 it said "Your 50
  triggers…".
- **Tidier small things:** the radio map's "Finding stations…" sits on a card
  instead of over the country names; the radio's filter boxes wrap onto more rows
  instead of reading "All coun"; Settings → Connection → Network activity fits its
  columns, Last included, without a scroll bar; the Voice tab points at the *Install
  speech recognition* button instead of an install.bat; the AI setup prompt's
  random-sound link no longer names a "Memes" category you don't have (it answered
  "not found"); and a computer-voice line no longer fails right after Windows speech
  had to be restarted.

## 1.6.5 — 2026-10-04

- **Sounds no longer stutter for the people you're talking to while the app is
  busy.** Whenever the window was drawing, the radio was loading or Onion Watch was
  checking the screen, what went into the virtual cable could break up: each piece
  of audio waited its turn behind the rest of the app and took 15 ms to make
  instead of half a millisecond, longer than it had. Starting a radio station made
  it worst. It now keeps pace whatever else the app is doing.
- **No more window freezes while you game:** the check for which game is in front
  (for the voice chat suggestion) looked the game up on disk every 3 seconds, and a
  drive that had gone to sleep froze the window for seconds at a time, with your
  sound hotkeys waiting behind it. It doesn't touch the disk any more.
- **The Radio tab doesn't freeze when it loads:** reading and saving the list of
  stations took the window (and the sound) away for up to a second. It's done in
  the background now.
- **Pressing a pad is lighter:** the first press of a long sound on a 44.1 kHz
  device no longer stops the window while the sound is converted (up to a second
  for a long song), each press no longer works out the sound's make-up gain again,
  and a press, a sound starting or stopping no longer redraws every pad on the
  board.
- **Myinstants search works again:** every search failed with "The site refused the
  download (403)".
- **No virtual cable needed: send your sounds anywhere.** Setup → Devices (and
  Settings → Audio → Devices) has **Send to others through**: *The virtual cable*
  (as before), *Another device* (Voicemeeter, a mixer, a capture card, a second
  sound card or any output OBS captures) or *Nowhere* (only you hear them, plus the
  stream output). With another device, Onion Board sends into the one you pick and
  never swaps the cable back in, stops asking you to install the cable, and the
  header pill turns green once it's sending (*Sending to: …*); the Setup tab says
  how to pick it up in OBS. *Nowhere* is for streamers whose OBS takes the sounds
  from Desktop Audio or the stream output: nothing goes out as a mic, and nothing
  nags. The setup guide's cable step has the same choice (*I don't use the
  cable*). The send device can't be your headphones (you'd hear everything twice,
  your own voice included), and *Nowhere* frees the cable to be the stream output.
  While nothing goes out to others, the header's Live switch says so (*Only you
  hear sounds*, or *Live — stream output only*) instead of *others hear you*.
- **Watch a pad's video:** a sound made from a video file, or from a link added
  with *Also save the video* on, now has a **Video** button in the player. It
  opens the video in its own window, in step with the sound: it plays, pauses,
  seeks and speeds up with it. The sound still goes out as normal; the video is
  only on your screen. Older versions of the app leave the links alone.
- **Settings → About:** the version, links to the website, source and license,
  ways to get in touch (feedback form, bug report, private security report), a
  note from the author, and the fine print in plain words. Instant replay's
  hotkey hint now also says to only keep clips of people who are fine with it.
- **Send feedback opens a form that needs no account:** Settings → Add-ons &
  help → Send feedback now opens a short form with your version filled in,
  instead of a GitHub bug report. The app still sends nothing itself.
- **Save your own voices:** Voice → Fine-tune effects has **Save as a voice…**.
  Name the mix and it gets its own button under *Pick a voice*, next to the
  built-in ones; right-click it to rename or delete it. A deleted voice can be put
  back with Undo, or from *Recently deleted* for 30 days. Saved voices go along
  with a backup's settings, and older versions of the app leave them alone.
- **Random voice shows what it did:** the dice is now the last voice button
  instead of a small button in the corner, and rolling it opens Fine-tune with
  the effects it set lit up for a few seconds.
- **The voice pictures are back** on the voice changer's buttons.
- **Keep the network activity list between starts:** tick *Keep a history
  between starts* under Settings → Connection → Network activity (or the new box
  on the installer's *Pick what you want* page) and every connection is saved on
  this PC and listed again next time, up to the last 1000. Off by default; nothing
  is sent anywhere, Clear empties it, and unticking it deletes the file.
- **Network activity totals:** **Totals…** beside Simple / Detailed opens a table
  of how much data went to each site (or each server): connections, sent,
  received, first and last time, sortable, and Copy pastes it into a spreadsheet.
  With a kept history it adds up the whole saved file, not just the 1000 the list
  shows. **Open log** opens that file.
- **Reset, with an undo:** Settings → General → Start over opens a short guide:
  tick what to reset (settings, hotkeys and optionally each sound's hotkey,
  sounds, Recently deleted, programs, audio devices), check the summary, and the
  app restarts with just those parts back to the start. A restore point is saved
  first, holding the settings and any sounds or bin it cleared, so **Restore
  points…** puts it all back (sounds added since are kept). The last 5 are kept.
- **Remote control for streamers, the easy way:** Settings → Remote has a
  **Streamer guide** (Stream Deck keys, channel points and chat commands through
  Streamer.bot, a panic button, with each link ready to copy) and **Copy AI
  prompt**, a message for ChatGPT / Claude that explains the links and lists your
  sounds so it can set up whatever tools you use with you (your key stays out of
  it unless you tick the box). The API can now also mute you (`/api/live`), switch
  the voice changer and mic, set the volume and category, replay the last sound
  and save the instant replay; `/api/help` lists every endpoint, and a mistyped
  sound name answers with what it probably meant.
- **The mini player always shows your sounds:** a web search's words stay in the
  search box, which also filters the pads, so a window made small afterwards
  showed a blank mini player (no pads, not even Bun). The mini player now shows
  every pad, and a board whose pads are all filtered out says so instead of
  showing nothing.
- **UI polish:** consistent painted icons replace emoji controls and search stats;
  search and app cards highlight on hover, with keyboard focus and playback on
  search cards. Compact voice controls, an Apps card-size slider that remembers
  its setting, and activity dots beside volume sliders reduce visual clutter.
  Country names now lead the flat map's label hierarchy, with quieter town names.
- **Honest download progress:** audio cards stay at 0% while preparing, show real
  download progress, and keep that progress visible while processing the audio.
- **Readable network activity:** theme-aware headers and alternating rows,
  bounded resizable columns, full-text tooltips and horizontal scrolling keep
  long entries from hiding the rest of the log.

- **A narrow window stays the whole app:** every tab now fits down to where the
  mini player takes over (about 440 px wide). The tab icons' spacing alone held
  it at about 480 px, so a narrow window turned into the mini player on whatever
  tab you were on.
- **Web search results that keep up with your clicks:** a result's *Play* or
  *Add* shows a progress bar on its card (and the percentage on the button), and
  the other cards wait until it's done, so a second click no longer cancels the
  first one (which then never played). *Add* then *Play* on the same card plays
  as soon as it's added, without downloading it again. Cards show views, likes
  and comments (YouTube's likes and comments fill in a moment later; YouTube
  hides dislike counts). The caption over the results and the paste-a-link hint
  are gone.
- **A smaller download: only the part of scipy that's used ships.** The app's own
  code no longer uses scipy, and the Triggers tab (Onion Watch) needs only its FFTs,
  so the build bundles scipy.fft, plus scipy.ndimage for Onion Watch 0.5.6, and
  leaves out the rest (signal, stats, optimize and the others): the installer is
  about 15 MB smaller and the installed app over 30 MB. Onion Watch 0.5.6 keeps
  working as it is. Its matcher is also a little quicker: 50 pictures are
  checked about every 300 ms at its 1% CPU share. Third-party effects modules that
  import other parts of scipy have to bring their own replacement; numpy, soxr and
  scipy.fft are still there.
- **Network activity** (Settings → Connection): see every connection the app
  makes, to check for yourself where it goes, and why: each one says what caused
  it (*You searched YouTube for “…”*, *You clicked Check now*, *Automatic update
  check*). *Simple* lists each server with why and what it was for, how often and
  how much data; *Detailed* lists each connection with its cause, route (direct, proxy, Tor), result, bytes each way, and the request,
  answer and encryption where the app can read them. Requests a switch turned
  away show as blocked. Kept in memory only: nothing is saved, logged or sent,
  and logins and key-like values in addresses are masked.
- **Tidier search results and category tabs:** web search results open with a
  *← My sounds* back button at the start of their header (it was *Back to my
  sounds*, alone at the far right), and the category tabs step aside while the
  results show, since they only pick pads. It brings back all your sounds: the web
  search left in the search box used to filter them down to the ones matching it. New categories are made with a small
  *+* right after the last tab instead of a *+ Category* button across the window.
- **City and town names on the radio maps:** zoom in on the flat map or the 3D
  globe and the cities and towns that have stations are named, so you can find
  your own place and its stations. Only the places in view are named, a few dozen
  at most, and none while zoomed out, so the maps stay as light as before. Search
  finds stations by city or region too, with or without accents ("zurich" finds
  Zürich).
- **Offline from the first start:** the installer's *Your privacy* page has an
  *Offline mode* box. Ticked, it switches Offline mode on before the app first opens
  (`OnionBoard.exe --set-offline`), so it never goes online, not even once, and
  unticks the installer's own downloads (VB-Cable, FFmpeg, live voice, Tor). It's
  ticked already when reinstalling over an app that's in Offline mode. Silent installs
  use `/OFFLINE=1`, which skips those downloads unless `/TASKS=` names them.
- **Search results and Apps as cards:** web search results are a grid of cards
  (picture on top, title, channel and length, Play and Add), as many across as
  the window fits, instead of full-width rows. The Apps tab shows each program as
  a card too, several side by side.
- **Restoring a maximized window no longer makes it the mini player:** the Radio
  tab's genre chips asked for room as if each sat on its own line (~300 px)
  whenever the window was big enough to show them, and every tab counts towards
  what the window needs. Widening a narrow window (e.g. 640 to 900 px with search
  results showing) could do the same: the window judged what fits by sizes Qt
  hadn't re-measured yet, brought back the long status pill, then found it too wide.
- **Get Onion Watch:** Hoot stands in the middle of his side of the card.
- **Better EQ:** the 7-band EQ and the voice *Tone* effect now follow the analog EQ
  curve they describe all the way up the treble. The 6 kHz and 12 kHz bands used to
  come out up to ~2 dB off (narrower and lop-sided, worst at 44.1 kHz); now they're
  within ~0.3 dB at every sample rate. The drawn EQ curve shows the same thing.
- **No more clicks when you move an EQ slider:** changing a band, a preset or a voice
  effect's knob crossfades from the old sound to the new over ~20 ms instead of
  switching at once, however small the audio buffer. Turning the EQ on or off,
  setting it back to flat or pointing it at something else fades too.
- **Our own filter engine:** all of the app's audio filters (EQ, voice effects,
  destination modes, the smart mono downmix, the limiter's look-ahead) now run on
  Onion Board's own code instead of scipy, and float32 audio is filtered more
  accurately than before.
- **Cleaner bottom bars:** My mic, What others hear and My headphones are three
  separate boxes. Each volume is a speaker icon, a slider and a plain % you can
  still click and type into (a typed volume applies on Enter, not digit by digit:
  "150" no longer dips a live mic through 1 % and 15 % on the way); the mic and
  radio level meters sit under their own volume slider. The Radio bar groups Play, random and star together, and its
  live button just says "Only me" or "LIVE".
- **Sounds playback controls:** the empty selection says "Pick a sound" with a
  tooltip explaining the controls, so the instruction fits instead of cutting off.

- **Settings categories:** a sidebar keeps all categories visible. Privacy &
  security groups online permissions, Connection holds proxy and Tor controls,
  Updates holds automatic update preferences, and Add-ons & help holds Onion
  Watch, feedback and support. Short labels and wrapped hints fit small windows.
  Theme previews use as many columns as fit, cards have space beside the scrollbar,
  and selected checkboxes and radio buttons show distinct ticks and centre dots.
- **Tor status:** leaving Offline mode refreshes the connection status immediately;
  Tor still starts only when needed.
- **Get Onion Watch:** retry a temporary GitHub gateway error once through the
  same connection and privacy gate, avoiding a cached failure. A persistent
  gateway error asks you to retry instead of blaming your internet connection.

- **Switch off anything that goes online**: Settings → Privacy & security has a switch
  for each thing the app does online (finding and downloading sounds, with one per
  site; updating yt-dlp; radio; Onion Board updates; add-ons; voice and speech-model
  downloads; custom voice servers; installing the virtual cable), and *Offline mode*
  on top that switches them all off. Off means no connection at all, through a proxy
  or not: the Radio tab says it's off instead of loading, the search bar only searches
  your own sounds, and the buttons that would go online are greyed with the reason.
- **More private radio**: the radio maps (the country outlines, the 3D globe and its
  Earth pictures) now come with the app instead of being downloaded, so opening the
  Radio tab doesn't contact a CDN at all. Stations play over `https` when the
  directory lists an `https` address for them. The app no longer tells Radio Browser
  which stations you play unless you turn that on in the new **Privacy** section
  (Settings → General), which also explains what the app sends where. Update checks
  no longer send the app's version number.
- **Privacy & security, the first tab in Settings**: what the app does online by
  itself, each with its own switch (checking for new versions, updating yt-dlp,
  telling Radio Browser what you play), the proxy setting below, and what goes online
  only when you ask. The installer's last page points to it. The General page no
  longer runs off the right edge of the window (the Remove Onion Watch button and the
  ends of the hints were cut off).
- **Send everything through a proxy**: Settings → Connection
  can send everything the app fetches (searches, downloads, the radio directory and
  its stations, thumbnails, updates, add-ons, translation models) through a SOCKS5
  or HTTP proxy, such as Tor's `socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050`. Site names are looked up
  by the proxy, not on your PC. If the proxy can't be reached, nothing is fetched,
  with a message saying why: the app never quietly goes direct. *Test* checks the
  address first, and switching applies at once (a playing station reconnects the
  new way).
- **Tor (optional)**: press **Get Tor** under Settings → Privacy & security →
  *Connection* (or tick *Private connection (Tor)* in the installer, unticked by
  default), then pick **Tor** there. The app doesn't ship Tor: it downloads the Tor
  Project's own (about 22 MB, through your proxy if you use one), checks it against
  a pinned checksum and shows how far the download has got. Where Tor is blocked,
  the download may be too. The sites you search and download from and the radio stations you
  play then see a Tor address instead of yours. Tor only runs while that's picked,
  shows how far it's got (*Connecting… 45%*, *Connected*), and until it's connected
  nothing is fetched: the app never goes direct behind your back. **New identity**
  switches to a different Tor route. **Hide that I'm using Tor** disguises the
  connection (Snowflake, or obfs4) for networks where Tor is blocked or frowned on;
  it's slower. YouTube often turns Tor away: the app tries up to three other Tor
  routes, then offers *Try this one without Tor*, which you have to click. Radio
  stations reconnect if their Tor route breaks. The switches above hold over Tor
  too: Offline mode never starts Tor, and *Get Tor* has a switch of its own.
- **The installer has a "Your privacy" page**, before the boxes: in plain words,
  what the app connects to and when, and what the *Private connection (Tor)* box
  does, with a link to the full list.
- A radio station that drops now really reconnects; before, the retry could end up
  replaying what was already received instead of opening the stream again.
- **Your headphones follow Windows' default output**: switch Windows from your
  headset to your speakers (or back) while the app is open and the sounds you hear
  move with it, instead of playing on the device you just switched away from. Picking
  a different headphones device by hand stops the following; picking Windows'
  default again turns it back on.
- **The Radio tab is much lighter**: it opens on a flat world map instead of the 3D
  globe. The map is drawn by the app itself (no web engine running behind it) and
  only redraws while you drag, zoom or hover a dot. It fills the whole area (no
  empty bands), names the countries as you zoom in, and wraps round sideways, so
  dragging stays smooth even zoomed all the way out. Hover a dot for the station,
  click to play, drag to move, scroll to zoom, double-click to zoom back out. The
  3D globe is still there: the map's **HD** button opens it (it's the
  old light globe; the spinning one with stars is gone), and **2D** goes back.
- **Less work behind a game**: with the window open but another program in front,
  the meters update 10 times a second instead of 30, and the logo, the mascots and
  the live-tab dots stop moving until you come back. Level meters only redraw when
  their bar changes, pads on another tab skip their visualiser, and the Apps tab
  no longer reloads every program's icon each refresh.

## 1.6.4 — 2026-10-03

- **A Sounds folder button** on the Sounds tab (also in the *Backup* menu) opens the
  folder your sounds are kept in. Sound files you drag into that folder join the board
  by themselves, once they've finished copying, including ones put there while the
  app was closed.
- **A short window keeps its pads**: below a certain height the window turns into
  the mini player, which only kept the pads above it when two rows of them fit. With
  big pads (or display scaling) that left an empty space above the player. One row
  is enough now.
- **Onion Watch 0.5.6** (Triggers tab, offered there as an update): the bottom bar's buttons have room around
  them, *Duplicate* and *Delete* sit on the *Fine-tune* line instead of a row of their
  own, and a trigger's pictures open big when clicked.

## 1.6.3 — 2026-10-03

- **Custom voices are easy to find**: an *Add voices…* button right beside the Voice
  list, and a *Custom voices* card in Settings → Audio (add a voice server, open the
  voices folder, or jump to them on the Voice tab). They used to be only at the bottom
  of the Voice tab's folded *More options*.

## 1.6.2 — 2026-10-03

- **A tidier right-click menu on a sound**: short names in three groups (play, change,
  share / remove), with what each does in its tooltip. The hotkey shows in the menu
  (*Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+1* → Change… / Remove hotkey), and the picture options are one
  entry.
- **Giving a sound a key that's already used says so**: "F2 plays “Airhorn” now — it
  was the key for “Boom”" (or *Stop everything*, or a category's random key), instead
  of quietly taking it.
- **The hotkey is near the top of Edit…**, under the name and volume, not below the
  timings.
- **Fixed: a screen trigger's sound could still play after the trigger was deleted**
  (or the sound taken off it) when its pad was set to *Wait first* or *Queue*.
- **Fixed: "Up next" stayed in the status line** after the queue ran out, was cleared,
  or its last sound was taken out with ✕.

## 1.6.1 — 2026-10-03

- **Custom text-to-speech voices** (Voice tab → More options → *Custom voices*): use
  a TTS server running on your PC (Kokoro, AllTalk, openedai-speech, LocalAI — any
  OpenAI-style `/v1/audio/speech` address, or one that takes `{text}` in the URL),
  a TTS program, or Piper voice packs dropped into the voices folder. They show up
  in the Voice list next to the Windows voices, follow the Speed slider, and work
  for typed lines and *Talk as a computer voice*.
- **A frozen window is noted down**: if Onion Board stops responding for 5 seconds,
  what it was doing is saved beside the crash reports, so a freeze can be fixed even
  when it can't be repeated. Nothing is shown or sent.
- **The queue shows above the pads**: *Up next* lists the sounds waiting, each with a
  ✕ to take it out (the status line that said so could be hidden).
- **The stream output can't be another end of the cable you already send into** (VB-Cable's
  "CABLE In 16ch" next to "CABLE Input"): everyone in the call would have heard
  everything twice.
- **Settings tidied**: the per-category hotkey sets are with the category keys; the
  stream output's rows line up; *Hotkey sounds* says which keys beep.
- **Onion Watch 0.5.5** (Triggers tab, offered there as an update): a cleaner trigger
  card, one line until you open it, settings grouped into Watch for / Then / Fine-tune;
  and sounds stop when their trigger or sound is removed.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-10-03

- **Stream output for OBS** (Settings → Audio): send what others hear to a device of
  its own and add it to OBS as its own audio track — your sounds, screen triggers,
  live radio and programs, and your voice (with the voice changer) if you like. It's
  clean: no voice chat shaping, still stereo, with its own volume. A second virtual
  cable (VB-Cable A+B) or any output you don't listen on works. Sounds set to *Only
  others hear it* go to the stream too.
- **One key, a random sound from the category you're on.** The new *Next category*
  / *Previous category* hotkeys switch the category in-game, with a beep for each
  step along (one for the first, two for the second…; a low one for All). The
  *Play a random sound* key, and the overlay, follow the category you switch to.
- **A set of hotkeys per category** (Settings → Hotkeys): turn on *Sound hotkeys only
  work in the category showing* and the same key can play a different sound in each
  category.
- **More hotkeys** (Settings → Hotkeys): play the last sound again, sounds louder /
  quieter by 10%, send my mic on / off, voice changer on / off, change my voice only
  while a key is held, and *All hotkeys off / on* (so they type normally in chat).
- **Queue sounds.** A sound's *On press* can be *Queue*: it waits for the sounds
  playing to finish. Right-click any pad → *Play next*, or a category → *Play them
  all, in order* / *shuffled*. *Stop everything* clears the queue.
- **New per-sound options** (Edit…): *Only others hear it* (not played in your
  headphones), *Wait first* (up to 10 s between the press and the sound) and
  *Cooldown* (presses are ignored for up to 60 s, so nobody can spam it).
- **One click plays a pad**, if you'd rather (Settings → General). Off by default.
- **Triggers tab: a sound clicked on a trigger card plays to you alone** (not into
  the call), and stops when it's taken off the card or the trigger is deleted.
- **Onion Watch 0.5.4** (Triggers tab, offered there as an update): alarms stop by
  themselves when you're back (the game moves, you alt-tab back, it's gone, you touch
  the mouse or keys, or only on Stop), and characters and creatures cut out of a
  game as transparent PNGs are matched properly.
- **Send feedback and Report a problem** (Settings → General): open a bug report in
  your browser with your version filled in. Nothing is sent from the app.
- **Remove Onion Watch** from Settings → General → *Add-ons*, not only from the end of
  the Triggers tab's More menu.
- **Fixed: Recently deleted on the Triggers tab could crash** with "No module named
  onionwatch.ui.deleted" after Onion Watch was updated while Onion Board was open. An
  add-on is now loaded in full when it starts, so replacing it on disk can't break the
  running copy.

## 1.5.9 — 2026-10-02

- **Headsets with "Virtual" in their name show up again.** Onion Board took any
  device named "...Virtual..." for a virtual cable and hid it, so a headset like
  "Speakers (HyperX Virtual Surround Sound)" was missing from the quick setup's mic
  and headphones lists: no microphone found, and your own sounds played on the wrong
  speakers while everyone in the call heard them fine. Only real cables (VB-Cable,
  Voicemeeter, Virtual Audio Cable) are hidden now.
- **Input and output in Settings.** Settings → Audio now has your mic, your
  headphones and the cable at the top, with a Re-scan button for a headset plugged
  in after Onion Board started. (The same pickers are still on the Setup tab.)

## 1.5.8 — 2026-10-01

- **Your settings are never swapped for an older copy just because they were busy.**
  If another program (OneDrive, an antivirus) still held `config.json` at startup,
  Onion Board treated it as damaged and loaded an older backup over it. It now waits
  longer, and if the file is still locked it loads the backup without saving over
  your newest settings.
- **Settings from a newer version are kept.** Opening a config written by a newer
  Onion Board keeps a copy (`config.json.newer`) before anything is saved, so the
  newer version's extra settings aren't lost.
- **A sound brought back gives up a hotkey that's been taken meanwhile.** If you gave
  a removed sound's key to Stop all (or another action) and then brought the sound
  back with Undo or Recently deleted, its pad showed a key that never played it.
- **Tweaking a voice preset no longer replaces "My own mix".** Picking a preset,
  nudging a slider and moving on to another voice used to save the nudged preset
  over the mix you'd made.
- **Bringing back a sound can't strand its files.** If its picture couldn't be moved
  back, the sound's audio was left outside Recently deleted and the sound couldn't
  come back; now the entry stays whole.
- **Turning off a MIDI controller lets go of the pads held on it**, so hold-to-play
  sounds stop instead of playing on.
- **A failed yt-dlp update can't break downloads.** If swapping in the new copy
  failed halfway, downloads could stay broken until a restart; the working copy is
  now put back, and leftovers from an interrupted update are tidied at startup.
- **Radio stations can't point into your home network by name.** A station whose
  web address resolved to your router or another device on your network is now
  refused, as stations with such an address already were.
- Smaller fixes: a file named only with underscores (like `_.wav`) became a pad that
  vanished on the next start; two long sounds that differed only near the end could
  be taken for the same sound when restoring a backup; a device name or error text
  with `<` or `&` in it could show garbled in the Discord and game guides; another
  program's `%APPDATA%\Soundboard` folder with a `sounds` folder in it could be
  mistaken for this app's old one.

## 1.5.7 — 2026-10-01

- **Push-to-talk can't get stuck down any more.** With an admin window or a Windows
  prompt in front, Windows can refuse the key-up after a sound; Onion Board now keeps
  trying until it goes through, instead of leaving your game's push-to-talk held.
- **A glitch from a captured program can't silence your call.** One broken block of
  audio from a program on the Apps tab could leave the people you're talking to
  hearing nothing until a restart; it's now turned into a moment of silence.
- **Recently deleted can't be wiped by a locked file.** If an antivirus or OneDrive was
  holding the bin's list just as you deleted a sound, everything else in the bin was
  lost from the list. Now it waits, and never saves over a list it couldn't read.

## 1.5.6 — 2026-10-01

- **The app icon follows your theme everywhere**: the taskbar's right-click menu,
  a taskbar pin and the Onion Board shortcuts on your Desktop and Start menu (so
  Start search too) now show the icon in your theme's colours, not always purple.
- **The version is on show**: in the title bar, the taskbar, the tray icon's
  tooltip and under the logo, so you can tell at a glance which one you're running.
- **The Radio globe no longer vanishes when you move the window** to another spot or
  screen, leaving its country names floating on an empty background. It redraws as
  you move, and the names hide whenever the globe can't be shown.
- **A friendlier wait while searching YouTube**: instead of a line of text in the
  corner, Bun or Hoot keeps you company in the middle of the results, over a sliding
  loading bar, until the results are in.

## 1.5.5 — 2026-10-01

- **Country and island names on the Radio globe**, so you can find places without
  knowing the map. Zoomed out you see the big countries; zoom in and the smaller
  ones and islands (Hawaii, the Caribbean, the Pacific) appear. Names never pile on
  top of each other, and the **Aa** button on the globe hides them.
- **Small windows work properly**: the mini player showed a blank space with a
  sideways scroll bar when you had no sounds; now it shows the "drop sounds here"
  bunny. Pads shrink to fit instead of running off the edge (two a row in the mini
  player, names never cut in half), a short window hides the mixer before squeezing
  the pads, and the Voice and Apps tabs no longer cut off on the right when narrow.
- **A tidier Settings window.** General had grown to a dozen cards, so it's split
  up: **Audio** (your mic, Who's listening, buffering), **Updates** (app updates
  and the downloader) and **Remote** (Stream Deck and scripts) are tabs of their
  own, and the hotkey beeps are on the Hotkeys tab. General keeps the window,
  tray, backup and support settings.

## 1.5.4 — 2026-09-30

- **Smoother Radio tab**: the globe is now light by default. It only draws while you
  use it, skips the stars and terrain, pins the 1,000 most-listened stations and
  stops drawing while the app is in the background, so the rest of the app no
  longer stutters. The **HD** button on the globe brings back the full, spinning
  version, and it's remembered.
- **✕ on the Apps tab works on any program**: it used to do nothing on a program
  you'd never sent. Now it takes the program off the list (it stays off, even
  while it runs) with an Undo bar, and *Forgotten programs…* brings it back.
- **Removing a sound asks first** (from a pad's menu, picked pads or the Delete
  key), and a *Recently deleted (n)* button beside Backup shows what's in the bin.
- *Remove Onion Watch…* is in Onion Watch's *More* menu instead of a row of its
  own under the Triggers tab.

## 1.5.3 — 2026-09-30

A mini player for small windows, a Recently deleted bin, and Onion Watch can be
removed.

- **Mini player**: make the window too small to use and it turns into a small
  player — what's playing, play / pause, stop, the seek bar, Live and Stop all —
  with your pads above it when there's room. Drag it bigger and the whole window
  comes back.
- **Resizing no longer flickers**: dragging the window's edge used to make parts
  of it flash in two places; now only the controls that actually need to hide or
  come back change.
- The tab bar never shows scroll arrows, and the category bar's arrows match the
  theme instead of looking like stock Windows buttons.
- **Onion Watch can be removed**: *Remove Onion Watch…* under the Triggers tab
  uninstalls the add-on after asking. Your triggers and their pictures are kept
  for when you get it again, and getting it again needs no restart.
- **Recently deleted**: a removed sound is kept for 30 days (Backup → *Recently
  deleted sounds…*) with its audio, picture and pad settings, and can be brought
  back after its Undo bar is gone. Forgetting a program on the Apps tab can be
  undone too (*Forgotten programs…*), and so can removing a custom mode. Picking a
  voice preset no longer wipes *My own mix*.
- **Controls sit next to what they control**: the Voice tab's mic meter and *Hear
  my voice* share the voice changer's on/off row, the computer voice's Voice and
  Speed come before its Start button, and Setup → *Test it* has its own *Hear what
  they hear* button.
- **The Apps tab's meters move live** instead of jumping every 1.5 seconds.
- **Themes**: dropdowns and menus are readable on every theme (they drew black on
  light ones), selected rows and ticked boxes read better, and switching theme
  recolours everything, the tray icon included.
- **Quitting always quits**: an invisible copy could be left running, so the next
  start said Onion Board was already running.

## 1.5.2 — 2026-09-30

*Who's listening* has a mode for every kind of game voice chat, and suggests the
right one for the game you're playing.

- ***Who's listening* has one mode per voice chat engine**: Discord, Vivox, Epic
  Online Services, Steam voice, Unity voice (Photon / Dissonance) and Low bandwidth
  (8 kHz), each saying which kinds of games use it. Every engine's own mic cleanup
  and voice gate were tested on 99 songs, from 808 trap to chipmunk vocals, to tune
  its mode: in every one, songs arrive within about 2 dB of playing the file
  straight in. The old *Game voice* mode is now called *Vivox*; your saved choice
  carries over.
- **The picker suggests the right mode for the game you're playing** when it can
  tell (Vivox and Unity voice games): the game's install folder is checked for its
  voice library. It only suggests; nothing switches on its own, and the game
  itself is never touched.
- **The game voice chat guide says how to choose**, and the Steam guide reminds you
  to pick *Steam voice*.
- **Livelier mascots.** When the board has no sounds, Bun begs for one in a speech
  bubble, cheers up while you drag files over him and hops for joy when clicked;
  Hoot waits the same way on the Triggers tab, and a glum Bun sits on an empty Apps
  tab.
- **Livelier pads**: a smooth hover, a press, a flash when a sound starts, and a
  breathing glow while it plays. The overlay's keys are drawn as keycaps.
- **Small fixes**: long app names end in "…" instead of being cut mid-word, "EQ off"
  is readable, and empty-state text has better contrast in the Light theme.
- **The installer is packed differently**, so virus scanners stop mistaking it for
  malware. It's a bit bigger to download.

## 1.5.1 — 2026-09-30

Songs come through game voice chat as loud as they should, bass and all. Tested on
99 songs, from 808-heavy trap to chipmunk-pitched vocals, through a model of a game
voice chat measured in a real game.

- **The *Who's listening* modes no longer turn bass-heavy songs down.** A song was
  levelled with its deepest bass counted, then the voice chat threw that bass away,
  so an 808 track reached your friends about 11 dB quieter than playing the file
  straight into the game. The Game, Discord and Steam modes now remove that bass
  themselves, give each sound back the level it took, and turn it into harmonics
  the chat keeps: every kind of song now arrives about as loud as the original,
  with the bass still there and less pumping on the kicks. Custom modes get the
  same choice (*Deep bass* in the mode editor).
- **The game voice chat guide explains push-to-talk better.** Some games' anti-cheat
  ignores keys pressed by other programs, so *Auto push-to-talk* can't open the mic
  there: hold the key yourself. And on voice activation some games send only
  speech, never music.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-09-30

The Triggers tab becomes Onion Watch.

- **The Triggers tab is now the Onion Watch add-on.** Onion Watch is the Triggers
  tab grown into its own project, and it plugs back in here: click *Get Onion
  Watch* on the tab and it's downloaded, checked and there in a moment, no
  restart. On top of what the tab did, it can watch a game's own window even while
  other windows cover it, tell two copies of a game apart, cut the picture straight
  out of the game window, and ring until you stop it (in your headphones, with a
  red Stop bar on the tab; Stop all stops it too). Your triggers and their pictures
  are kept as they were and work again as soon as it's installed. Nothing is
  downloaded until you click, and a newer Onion Watch is offered on the tab with
  the app's own update check.

## 1.4.2 — 2026-09-30

Better help for game voice chat, from testing what ~20 games' voice chats do to
your sounds.

- **The project moved to [github.com/Onion-Alien/onion-board](https://github.com/Onion-Alien/onion-board)**
  and its website to [onion-alien.github.io/onion-board](https://onion-alien.github.io/onion-board/).
  The old addresses still lead there. Updates keep working: this version takes an
  installer from either address.
- **"Game has no microphone setting?" now covers voice chat too.** Windows keeps
  a separate *default communication device*, and that's the one many games' voice
  chat asks for. The steps now set the cable as both, not just the default device.
- **The game voice chat guide names more of the settings that mangle sounds**:
  *denoiser* and *background sound removal* as well as noise suppression. The AI
  denoisers in VRChat and Minecraft's Simple Voice Chat take music out almost
  completely.

## 1.4.1 — 2026-09-29

A fix for the new self-update.

- **The app opens again properly after an update.** After *Update now → Restart
  now*, the new version installed fine but crashed as it reopened ("Importing the
  numpy C-extensions failed"): it was started with the old version's internal
  settings. The installer now reopens it the way a double-click does, and the app
  starts the installer without them. If an update left you with that error, just
  open Onion Board again: the new version is installed and works.
- **The update window's notes read properly**: plain text, whole sentences, no
  stray `**` marks.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-09-29

Drum pads, instant replay and hold-to-play: play your sounds from a MIDI pad
controller, clip what a friend just said and play it straight back at them.

- **MIDI pad controllers work as hotkeys.** Plug in an Akai LPD8 / MPD, a
  Launchpad or any USB MIDI keyboard, click a hotkey and hit a pad instead of
  pressing a key. No extra software needed. Pads play sounds and can do anything
  a hotkey does (stop, pause, random sound, the overlay). A controller is only
  opened while a hotkey uses it, so your music app keeps your other MIDI gear. If
  another program has it open, Onion Board says so and picks it up once it's free.
- **Instant replay.** Give *Save what you just heard* a key (Settings → Hotkeys)
  and the last 30 seconds of everything your PC plays (a friend in Discord, the
  game, a video; not Onion Board's own sounds) are kept in memory. Press it after
  something funny and it's a new pad. Nothing is saved or sent anywhere until you
  press it.
- **Hold to play.** A sound can play only while its hotkey or pad is held down, and
  stop the moment you let go, like an air horn (Edit → *Hold to play*).
- **Solo sounds.** A new *On press* choice, *Solo*, stops every other sound
  before it plays.
- **Mute my mic while a sound plays** (Setup → *Who's listening*): others hear
  only the sound, and your mic comes back the moment it ends.
- **Voice changer and Discord:** while the voice changer is on, a notice explains
  that Discord deletes most of a changed voice unless its *Input Profile* is
  *Studio*, with a *Show me how* button. Measured in a real call: on the default
  Voice Isolation only about 20% of a Deep voice got through; on Studio 93%, at the
  same volume.
- Developers: `scripts/discord_roundtrip.py` measures what a second client in a real
  Discord call receives (raw vs the app vs Discord mode, plus the mic path). The
  codec bench now models Discord's ~94 Hz capture high-pass, found in that test.

## 1.3.3 — 2026-09-29

Onion Board now updates itself, plus 25 new themes and an overlay you can drag
anywhere. This is the last version you have to install by hand: from here on the
*Update* button at the top does it for you.

- **Onion Board updates itself.** When a new version is out the *Update* button
  at the top offers *Update now*: it downloads the new installer in the
  background, checks it's exactly the file on GitHub, and when you click
  *Restart now* installs it and opens the app again. Your sounds and settings
  are kept, and the virtual cable isn't touched. The daily check for a new version
  is now on by default (untick it in Settings → General); it only reads GitHub's
  release list. Coming from 1.3.2 or older, install this version by hand once.
- **Triggers see fullscreen games on a portrait monitor.** A rotated monitor never
  got Desktop Duplication (it fell back to GDI, which sees fullscreen games as
  black); its sideways frames are now read and turned upright.
- **25 new themes, 31 in all**, grouped in Settings → Appearance: Classic
  (Midnight for OLED screens, Slate, Arctic, Paper, High Contrast), Colourful
  (Vampire, Forest, Mocha, Sunset, Royal, Onion, Mint), Wild (Synthwave with a
  neon grid, Vaporwave, Blood Moon, Lava, and Amber Terminal and Hacker with CRT
  scanlines and a terminal font) and Meme (Flashbang, Barbie, Swamp, Deep Fried,
  Retro 98, Comic Sans, Brainrot).
- **Put the overlay where you want it.** Drag it by any empty part (its title,
  its edges) and it opens there from then on — on any monitor. Settings → Overlay
  picks the monitor (the game's, the main one, or a particular screen, say a
  second monitor next to the game) and one of nine spots.
- **The logo reacts to everything that plays.** The glowing onion in the header
  followed only what others hear, so the radio or a program on *Only me* left it
  still, and talking into your mic made it flare. It now glows with any sound, the
  radio or a captured program, wherever they go, and never with your voice. The
  title bar, taskbar and tray icons glow along with it.

## 1.3.2 — 2026-09-29

A fresh coat of paint: the same app, tidier controls and pictures for the voices.

- **A cleaner look.** Dropdowns have a slim arrow and open as a list below the box
  with rounded, highlighted rows; number boxes (Triggers' Wait, Not again for,
  Match) get matching arrows; menus, tooltips and scrollbars are tidied up; sound
  chips on a trigger are round again; a clearer Settings gear and folder icon.
  Nothing has moved.
- **Pictures for the voices.** Voice changer tiles, the computer voice and its
  languages can show a picture (from `assets/art`), and while one is on the Voice
  tab shows it. Missing pictures fall back to the emoji and icons as before.
- **The window still shrinks to small sizes with the new look.** The Triggers tab's
  "Check every" list got wider with its new arrow and held the window at a larger
  minimum width; it now gives way like the screen list beside it.

## 1.3.1 — 2026-09-28

A bug-fix release from testing the whole app for real on a two-monitor PC, plus
three Triggers upgrades that came out of it.

- **The in-game overlay opens on the monitor your game is on.** On a second
  monitor it used to appear on the main one (Qt 6 names screens differently from
  Windows, so the overlay never recognised the game's monitor).
- **Triggers work on HDR screens.** A monitor with HDR (advanced colour) on hands
  the app its frames in a different format than it announces; the copy came
  out black, so nothing ever matched. A screen where nothing moves is read
  straight away now too.
- **Triggers: the screen picker no longer cuts off the screen's size.**
- **Triggers can watch several screens at once.** Each trigger can pick its own
  screen on its card, so a picture on your second monitor and one on your main
  monitor both work at the same time. The picker at the bottom stays the screen
  for triggers that don't pick one.
- **A trigger can look for several pictures and play several sounds.** Add up
  to 100 pictures to one trigger (any of them fires it) and give it a list of
  sounds, played one at random (each once before any repeats), in order, or all
  at once.
- **The Radio and Apps tabs light up while they're sending sound**, like Triggers
  and Voice already did, and a live tab's name is tinted too, not just the dot.
- **The window shrinks to small sizes again** (the new Triggers screen pickers
  stopped it).

## 1.3.0 — 2026-09-28

Sound quality on the other end. Measured, not guessed: the codec Discord and
games use keeps nearly everything, so most of the damage came from voice chat's
own mic cleanup, a cable converting on the way through, and how the sound was
sent. Onion Board now fixes what it can itself and tells you exactly which
setting to flip for the rest.

- **Your sounds come through clean in Discord.** Discord cleans up your mic for
  talking, and left on, that cleanup treats music and sound effects as noise and
  chops them up. The setup guide and the Setup tab now say what to switch off
  (Discord: *Input Profile → Studio*), with a guide for game voice chat too.
- **Check Discord.** With Discord's *Let's Check* running, one click plays a short
  test into your mic, listens to what Discord plays back, and tells you exactly
  which Discord setting is still hurting your sounds: noise suppression, the
  voice-activity gate cutting quiet parts, or automatic gain control pumping the
  volume.
- **Loud sounds don't crackle on the other end.** Voice chat's codec pushes peaks
  back up after it squeezes them, so a loud song that left here at full volume
  clipped in your friends' ears. Onion Board now leaves room for that, with a real
  limiter that turns the level down around a peak instead of distorting it.
- **Stereo sounds don't lose parts in mono.** Every voice chat sends one channel.
  Out-of-phase bass and wide stereo effects used to cancel out when Discord or a
  game mixed them down; Onion Board now does the mix-down itself, smarter, before
  they get the chance. On by default (Setup tab → *Who's listening* → *Send in
  mono*).
- **Lower my sounds while I talk** (Setup tab → *Who's listening*): your sounds dip
  under your voice so a song doesn't bury what you say. Off, a little, half or a
  lot.
- **Speeding up or slowing down sounds live sounds cleaner** (better interpolation).
- **The virtual cable passes your sound through untouched.** Windows sometimes
  puts one end of the cable on 44.1 kHz, and the cable then converts everything on
  the way through. The Setup tab spots it and fixes it in one click (the setup
  guide does it for you).

## 1.2.3 — 2026-09-27

A bug-fix release from a feature-by-feature test of the whole app.

- **Onion Board always starts.** A damaged setting (from an old backup, a
  hand-edited config, or an add-on with a broken slider) used to stop the app
  from opening, every time: a huge volume or EQ value, a broken voice changer,
  text-to-speech or "Who's listening" setting, a bad Apps-tab volume or API port.
  The damaged value now just goes back to its default.
- **Hotkeys don't fight each other or your keyboard.**
  - On keyboards other than US English, the default overlay key (the one left of
    1) types a letter or everyday punctuation, such as ö, ñ or the UK ' key, and
    Onion Board took it away from typing everywhere. There it's now Alt + that
    key, and hotkeys show the character your keyboard really prints.
  - The game's push-to-talk key can no longer also be one of Onion Board's
    hotkeys (it used to catch its own key presses instead of the game).
  - Renaming or deleting a category updates its random-sound hotkey straight
    away, and a numpad overlay key closes the overlay again.
- **The in-game overlay shows what's playing** (progress, Pause/Resume) while the
  main window is in the tray, which is how it's normally used.
- **Backups and the Sounds tab are sturdier.** Sounds in less common formats
  (.au, .caf, .w64) come back when you restore a backup. Restoring right after
  deleting all your sounds brings them back instead of skipping them. "Save as
  new sound" keeps the copy's categories and fades, Undo no longer brings back a
  category you just renamed or deleted, imported sounds join an existing category
  whatever its capitals, empty audio files are refused with a clear message, and
  the Edit dialog no longer lowers some volumes by 1%.
- **Triggers are more reliable.** Big pictures and full-screen screenshots are
  kept at their real size, so they match; cut-outs with thin outlines are found;
  a graphics-driver reset or a screen briefly unplugging no longer switches
  watching off; a refused picture no longer replaces the trigger's old one; tiny
  pictures no longer slow every check down; screens plugged in later show up.
  A trigger whose sound was removed says so instead of claiming it played.
- **Voice tab.** "Windows default" really speaks in the default voice after you've
  used another one, a saved voice that has since been uninstalled falls back to
  the default, and a line the voice can't read (Chinese with an English voice,
  say) says so instead of staying silent. Add-ons whose `module.json` was saved
  with a byte-order mark (Notepad) load.
- **Record 6s** no longer says your voice isn't getting through when the voice
  changer is on; in computer-voice mode it says your real voice is muted instead
  of blaming the send switch. Live speed / pitch no longer changes the test
  playback, cue beeps or previews.
- **The "Old radio" effect** no longer adds 3 seconds of static to a sound (before
  it, when reversed), and slowing down long sounds uses far less memory.
- **Radio.** Favourites and stations you've played pick up a station's new stream
  address instead of staying on a dead one; a radio volume of 0 is remembered;
  when one directory mirror answers with a maintenance page the next one is used;
  "Last 15s" only holds (and is named after) the station that played. Station
  links can no longer reach your PC or home network with an address written in
  an unusual form (like `127.1`).
- **Links and web search.** One slow link lookup no longer holds up every search
  and download; pressing *Add* on a second result while one is downloading adds
  it next instead of doing nothing; typing a link by hand looks it up once.
- **Local control API (Stream Deck).** A request answered "busy, try again" no
  longer runs later as well, so a retrying button can't play a sound twice.
- **Settings.** "Start with Windows" shows off when it's been switched off in Task
  Manager, and ticking it turns it back on there; *App updates* only says "You
  have the newest version" after it really checked.
- **Readable on light themes.** Green, amber and red status text (setup guide,
  header, warnings everywhere) was hard to read on Light and Cherry Blossom; each
  theme now has its own readable shades.
- **Setup guide.** Closing it without finishing no longer swaps in another mic or
  headphones for a headset that happens to be unplugged.
- **Problem reports** that came up while you were in a game now really appear when
  you switch back, and hide your Windows user name more thoroughly (short `~1`
  paths, web-style paths, device names).
- **Odds and ends.** Launching Onion Board again while it's still starting brings it
  to the front. A settings file saved by Notepad (with a byte-order mark) no longer
  counts as damaged. First start no longer adopts another program's
  `%APPDATA%\Soundboard` folder. Opening Settings over and over no longer makes
  theme changes slower. Updating clears out the old version's program files.

## 1.2.2 — 2026-09-27

- **Triggers keep working when a game switches display mode.** When a game went
  into (or out of) exclusive fullscreen at another resolution, the screen capture
  quietly froze on its last picture or went black, and the tab told you to switch
  to borderless. The capture now follows the screen's real size, rescales your
  pictures to it, says "Waiting for the screen to come back" while the switch
  happens, and starts itself afresh if it can't recover.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-09-27

- **Installing an update while Onion Board is open works.** The installer's
  request to close the app used to just hide it to the tray, so setup stopped
  with "unable to close all applications". It now closes properly (logging off
  or shutting Windows down with the app open is handled the same way).
- **Custom destination modes: the form works straight away.** With no custom
  modes yet, its fields ignored clicks and typing until you pressed *Add*. Now
  the first thing you type makes the mode.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-09-27

- **New Triggers tab: play a sound when something shows up on your screen.**
  Give it a picture (paste one cut with Win+Shift+S, or pick a file), for example
  a game's "YOU DIED", and the sound to play. It plays straight away or after a
  wait you set, once per appearance, with a cooldown and an adjustable match
  level that shows the live match next to it. Checks every 100 ms by default
  (down to 16 ms). It sees fullscreen games too, and transparent parts of a
  picture (a cut-out icon) are ignored, so it matches whatever is behind them.
  Watching is remembered, so it carries on next time the app opens.
- **Who's listening is on the Setup tab.** The Discord / Steam / game voice modes
  (and *Custom modes…* for any other codec) were only in Settings → General; they
  now have their own card under Devices. Settings keeps a copy, and the two stay
  in step.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-27

- **Installing the virtual cable no longer takes over your speakers.** Windows
  often makes "CABLE Input" the default speakers (and "CABLE Output" the default
  mic) when the cable installs, which silenced the PC until you switched back by
  hand. The installer now remembers your defaults and puts them back.
- **Two new themes:** Cherry Blossom (light sakura pink) and Carbon (graphite grey
  with a carbon-fibre weave).
- **Uninstalling offers to remove the cable again after a reinstall.** The installer
  now asks Windows whether a cable is really there instead of looking for files VB-
  Audio's uninstaller leaves behind, so it remembers when it was the one that
  installed the cable.
- **A much smaller download.** The build now leaves out the parts of Qt the app
  never uses (QML, 3D, charts, Chromium's developer tools, translations) and
  compresses harder: about a third of the previous installer size, and the
  installed app is about 60% smaller. Every build proves the trimmed app still
  starts (`OnionBoard.exe --selftest`, headless) before it's packaged.
- **Less CPU while hidden.** In the tray or minimised, the window's 30-a-second
  meter and visualiser timer slows to 4 a second (push-to-talk, the device
  watchdog and the test recording carry on as before), and the Programs tab
  re-reads the audio sessions every 5 s instead of every 1.5 s.
- **Nothing pops up over your game.** A crash report for an error that didn't stop
  the app waits until Onion Board is in front again instead of appearing over
  whatever you're doing, and the "settings were restored" notice waits for the
  window to be opened when the app started hidden in the tray.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-27

The first public release, as **Onion Board** (it was called Soundboard). Your
sounds and settings move over by themselves the first time it starts.

- **New licence: MIT with the Commons Clause.** Still free to use (streams and
  videos included), copy, change and share, but not to sell. 0.1.0 and 0.2.0
  stay plain MIT.

- **Uninstalling asks whether to remove the virtual cable too** (Yes by default
  only if Onion Board installed it; say No if another program uses it).
- **Settings → General → Support Onion Board** opens the project page's Support
  section, if you'd like to chip in.

### Security and fixes from the pre-release audit

- A pasted Myinstants link could write a file outside the download folder, and
  the clean-up afterwards could delete that folder. Link file names are now
  sanitized, and only the app's own temp folders are ever deleted.
- Names that come from the web (video and channel titles, radio stations, window
  titles) and your own sound names are shown as plain text: before, text that
  looked like HTML was drawn as HTML, which could load pictures from other PCs.
- Upgrading from Soundboard 0.1.0 no longer loses every sound, and the data
  folder still moves over if the installer already made the new one.
- Importing a backup or sound pack: bad numbers are ignored, the total size and
  your free disk space are checked first, and imported speech settings only
  accept the app's own models.
- If `config.json` goes missing, it's restored from its automatic backups.
- The virtual-cable installer unpacks into a folder only admins can write to
  and checks VB-Audio's certificate by name.
- Radio stations that point into your own PC or home network are skipped.
- A sound can no longer get stuck "playing" (holding push-to-talk down) when
  an audio device drops out; after Windows restarts a stalled device, sounds
  that were playing carry on through it instead of going silent there.
- Turning pitch or speed on while a sound plays no longer cuts out for a moment.
- "&" in a sound or category name no longer creates a hidden keyboard shortcut.
- The Radio, Voice and Apps tabs stop their meters while you're on another tab,
  so the app idles more quietly on a laptop battery.
- Text-to-speech works on Windows set to other languages, and installing voices
  works when your Windows user name has an apostrophe in it.

### Everything else new since 0.2.0

- **The Browser tab is gone; search the web from the Sounds tab instead.** Its
  audio stuttered, the page hitched when switching modes, and it cost the game
  a whole Chromium. Type in *Search sounds* and press Enter (or *Search*): the
  results replace the pads, and the **YouTube** / **SoundCloud** buttons above
  them switch sites. *Play* plays a result once, *Add* keeps it as a pad — only
  the audio is downloaded. TikTok, Instagram, X, Reddit and the rest have no
  search without an account, so paste a link to the video instead. The
  Browser hotkeys (record, last 15 s, play / pause, LIVE) went with it; the
  Radio tab keeps its own *Record* and *Last 15s*.
- **Pick several pads at once.** Ctrl+click adds or removes a pad, Shift+click
  picks a range, Ctrl+A picks everything showing, Esc clears. A bar under the pads
  (or right-clicking a picked pad) changes them all: colour, volume, fades,
  categories, export, or *Delete* — one *Undo* brings them all back.
- **Fade in / fade out per sound.** *Edit…* → *Fade in* / *Fade out* (up to 10 s).
  Stopping a sound fades it out instead of cutting it, and one that isn't looping
  fades over its last seconds. *Stop everything* still cuts straight away.
- **A "play a random sound" hotkey.** Settings → Hotkeys: plays a random sound from
  the category showing, never the same one twice in a row. Each category can have
  its own (right-click its tab → *Set a random-sound hotkey…*).
- **Remote control for Stream Deck and scripts (opt-in).** Settings → General →
  *Remote control* starts a small API on `127.0.0.1`: `/api/play?name=Airhorn`,
  `/api/random?category=Memes`, `/api/stop`, `/api/pause`, `/api/sounds`… Every
  request needs the key shown there. Works with a Stream Deck's API-request /
  website buttons, Bitfocus Companion, Touch Portal, AutoHotkey or `curl`.
- **Screen readers.** Pads are real buttons now: a screen reader reads each
  sound's name, then whether it's playing, its hotkey, length and categories.
  Tab and the arrow keys move between pads, Enter or Space plays, Ctrl+Space
  picks, the Menu key opens a pad's menu. Icon-only buttons (■, ✕, ⚙…) get names
  from their tooltips.
- **Trim a sound.** Right-click a pad → *Effects…* → *Trim*: drag the start and
  end handles on the waveform (or type exact times) and only that part plays —
  keep one line out of a 4-minute video. It's stored with the sound's effects, so
  the file is never cut and *Keep all* undoes it at any time. Presets keep the trim.
- **Categories.** Tabs above the pads (*+ Category*); a sound can be in several
  (right-click a pad → *Categories*). Search finds category names too. The in-game
  overlay shows the same category, and **R** (numpad **\***) switches category
  from inside the game.
- **Remove can be undone.** No more "Are you sure?": *Removed “…” · Undo* stays
  up for 10 seconds, and afterwards the audio file goes to the Recycle Bin
  instead of being deleted.
- **Backup, move to a new PC, share.** *Backup → Export everything* writes every
  sound (with its picture, effects, hotkey and categories) and your settings to
  one `.zip`; *Import…* (or dropping the zip on the pads) brings it back on any
  PC. Categories and single pads export as sound packs; importing skips sounds
  you already have, and a backup's settings are only used if you say so (your
  devices are never touched). The format is documented in
  `docs/BACKUP-FORMAT.md`.
- **Keeps running in the tray.** Closing the window no longer stops your hotkeys:
  the app stays in the tray (right-click → *Quit* to exit; switch it off in
  Settings → General). New: *Start with Windows*, straight to the tray.
- **Update check (opt-in).** Settings → General → *Tell me when a new version is
  out* asks GitHub once a day and shows an *Update* button when there is one. It
  never downloads anything itself; *Check now* works without the opt-in.
- **When something breaks, you can tell us in two clicks.** Any error the app
  didn't expect — on any thread, not just the window's — now opens a *hit a
  problem* window with the full report: what failed, where, and the last lines
  of the log, with your Windows user name and folders already blanked out.
  *Report on GitHub* copies it and opens a new issue for you to paste into;
  *Copy report* lets you send it any other way. Nothing is sent by itself. The
  same bug won't pop up twice, and a report is kept in
  `%APPDATA%\OnionBoard\crash-reports\` (last 10). If the app can't start at
  all, it now says why instead of silently not appearing.
- **Who's listening (Settings → General).** Voice chat runs your sounds through
  a mono voice codec. Measured: it drops the sub-bass under 100 Hz everywhere,
  and Steam voice cuts everything above 12 kHz (some game codecs above 8 kHz);
  100 Hz–6 kHz gets through untouched. Pick where your sounds are going —
  Discord, Steam voice, game voice, low-bandwidth game voice — and they're
  shaped to survive it: the bass that would be lost becomes harmonics the codec
  keeps, the level is evened out for the service's gate and auto gain, what
  you monitor is what they hear. *Custom modes…* describes any other service by
  the same knobs. Off (the default) sends sounds exactly as mixed. For
  developers, `scripts/codec_bench.py` is the measuring tool behind it.
- **Apps tab: send one program's sound through your mic.** Pick any program
  that's playing — a music player, a browser, a game, even a call in another
  app — and its sound goes out to whoever's listening, on its own volume, without
  touching anything else you play. It's a copy: the program keeps playing on your
  speakers as before. Each program has **Send**, a volume and *Hear it myself*;
  programs you switch on are remembered by their .exe and picked up again next
  time they run. Auto push-to-talk counts them, and Stop all switches them off.
  Uses Windows' per-process loopback (Windows 11, or Windows 10 build 20348+).
- **Fewer restarts after installing the virtual cable.** If Windows says the new
  cable needs a restart, the installer first tries to wake it without one:
  it restarts the cable's devices and the Windows audio service, then waits
  longer for it to come up. You only get asked to restart if that fails too.
  It now asks for permission once, up front. In the setup guide, **Install it
  now** sets Bun off: he dashes away, there's a cartoon dust cloud, and he comes
  back with a hammer and a plank and builds while a checklist shows each step
  (downloading, installing, checking, waking it up). If Windows still wants a
  restart, restart whenever suits you: after you next log in, Onion Board opens
  by itself (once) on the cable step. Bun welcomes you back when it's working,
  or you can **try once more without restarting**. This uses a per-user RunOnce
  entry, so there's no background task and nothing is left behind.

- **Renamed to Onion Board.** Was Soundboard. `%APPDATA%\Soundboard` is migrated
  to `%APPDATA%\OnionBoard` automatically on first launch (settings, sounds,
  cache, browser profile — nothing is lost). The exe, log file name, debug env
  var (`ONIONBOARD_DEBUG`) and app identifiers changed to match.

- **Radio tab.** Listen to ~60 000 internet radio stations from around the world
  (the free, open [Radio Browser](https://www.radio-browser.info) directory). A 3D
  globe shows the most-listened ~3000 as dots: spin it, hover for the name, click
  to tune in. Or search by name, genre or country. Stars keep your favourites.
  The radio has its own volume, *Hear it myself* and **LIVE** (off every launch),
  so it can go out through your mic like a sound, and *Record* / *Last
  15s* turn it into pads. Stop all stops it too, and auto push-to-talk counts it.
  Hovering a dot shows a card with the station's country and region, genres,
  language, audio quality, plays today (and the trend), votes and when it was last
  checked working. Zoom with the scroll wheel, Ctrl +/− or the corner buttons;
  ☾ / ☀ switches between the daytime Earth and the city-lights night view.

- **Voice changer voices rebuilt.** The pitch shifter is now a WSOLA splice
  shifter (the SoundTouch approach) instead of a two-head delay line, so Chipmunk,
  Deep voice and Demon no longer warble; Robot is a 16-band vocoder (words on a
  synth buzz) instead of a ring modulator; the reverb is a damped Freeverb that no
  longer rings like a pipe or piles up bass. New building blocks: Compressor,
  Tone (bass / presence / treble) and Chorus, and Echo repeats can darken. The
  voices are now Chipmunk, Deep voice, Demon, Robot, Alien, Ghost, Walkie-talkie,
  Old telephone, Megaphone, Stadium announcer, Cave and Podcast voice, each
  levelled to come out about as loud as your real voice. Pitch latency is ~50 ms.
- **Pictures on pads.** A sound added from a link (YouTube, TikTok, SoundCloud…)
  gets the video's thumbnail; an imported mp3/m4a/video gets its cover art or
  first frame (with ffmpeg). Right-click a pad → *Add picture…* to pick any image,
  or drop an image file onto a pad; *Remove picture* takes it off.
- **Pads show what's playing.** A playing pad now has a live spectrum
  visualizer (bars that bounce with the sound, with falling peak caps), a thin
  progress line along the bottom and a glowing border, instead of a flat fill.
- **The computer voice speaks other languages.** *Speak in* on the Voice tab: talk
  in English and the voice says it in Chinese, Spanish, French, German or Russian.
  Each language is an add-on you download only when you pick it (65–195 MB, an
  offline Argos Translate model), so translation runs on your PC and what you say
  never leaves it. It uses that language's Windows voice, and tells you how to add
  one if it's missing. Existing live-voice installs need *Update speech
  recognition* (More options) once, for the translation tokenizer.
- **More Windows voices.** Text-to-speech now also finds the newer Windows voices
  (Mark, George, Susan… and any language voice you add in Windows settings), not
  just the classic desktop ones.
- **Add or play a sound from a link.** Paste a link into *Search sounds* on the
  Sounds tab (YouTube, SoundCloud, TikTok, X, Reddit, direct audio/video links and
  most other media sites, via yt-dlp). It's looked up and shows its title, then
  **Add as sound** (or Enter) downloads its audio into your Sounds, and **Play
  once** plays it through your mic without keeping it. Adding after playing reuses
  the same download.
- **Effects on any sound.** Right-click a pad → *Effects…* (or the new *Effects*
  tab in *Edit…*) to change its speed and pitch (separately, or together with
  *Tape mode*), EQ, boost (up to +36 dB, which clips on purpose), play it backwards,
  or add any voice effect (echo, reverb, distortion, radio, robot, add-on effects).
  Presets include **Ear rape**, Bass boosted, Slowed + reverb, Nightcore, Chipmunk,
  Demon and Reversed. *Preview* plays it to you only. *Save* changes the pad, and
  *Save as new sound* keeps the original and adds the edited version as its own
  pad. The original file is never touched, and pads with effects show **FX**.
- **Speed and pitch while you listen.** A `1x` button on the Sounds transport
  slows down or speeds up (0.25×–2×) and shifts the pitch (±12 semitones) of
  whatever is playing, keeping the pitch when the speed changes or not. It isn't
  saved; use Effects to keep a version.

- **Voice tab redesigned so it's obvious how to use it.** The voice changer comes
  first: one big switch (green when on: everyone hears your changed voice), a grid
  of voices to click (Chipmunk, Robot, Old telephone…; clicking one turns it on), a
  *Hear my voice* button and a mic meter right there, and the individual effects
  folded under *Fine-tune effects*. It says plainly that there's nothing to start:
  it works on your mic whenever it's on. Live voice-to-speech is now *Talk as a
  computer voice*, with its rarely-changed options under *More options*.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-26

### Added
- **Any window size.** The window shrinks down to 300 × 300 and stays usable:
  as it gets smaller, labels shorten, buttons drop to icons, the less-used controls
  tuck away (pad size, meters, extra volume boxes, quick links, then the mixer strip)
  and the Setup and Voice pages go to one column. Everything comes back as it grows.
  It used to stop at about 1070 px wide.
- The version is shown in the title bar.

### Changed
- **Add-ons always come with the app.** The retro effect and the live
  voice-to-speech add-on are part of every install, so the Voice tab always offers
  *Install speech recognition* and then *Start talking as the voice*. Before, the
  live-voice add-on was only there if its installer box was ticked, and otherwise the
  tab just said to put a folder you didn't have into the add-ons folder. The
  installer's box now means "set it up now" (it can also be done later from the tab).
- Python 3.12 or newer is needed to run from source or to set up live voice (the
  pinned numpy and SciPy need it); the docs and `install.ps1` said 3.11.

### Fixed
- **Browser tab stuck after switching sites.** With Lite on, clicking another site
  (say SoundCloud) while a YouTube video played left the page hidden behind the
  mini-player, and the stalled-playback watchdog then flashed it 2 px tall; clicks did
  nothing. Loading any new page now brings it back, and the watchdog only acts on a
  player that has actually loaded something.
- Numpad **+** can be used as a hotkey (it was saved under a name that couldn't be
  read back, so it silently never worked). A hotkey that can't be read is now listed
  as not working instead of being skipped.
- A settings file that is valid JSON but damaged no longer stops Soundboard from
  starting: the last good backup is used, and a damaged sound entry is skipped.
- The Record-6s test gives up with a message if the virtual cable's output goes away
  mid-test, instead of leaving the button disabled.
- Sounds added while the library was still loading at startup kept their decoded
  cache (it was pruned against the list from before they were added).
- The play / pause button takes the new theme's colour straight away.
- Closing the setup guide with X or Esc shows the devices picked in it in the
  Devices card (only *Finish* used to refresh them).
- Removing a sound also stops its headphone preview; quitting mid-recording no
  longer leaves `recording.tmp.wav` behind.
- The Setup tab's *Hotkeys & auto push-to-talk* button showed an underlined "a"
  instead of the "&".
- `pip install .` included only part of the package; `install.ps1` couldn't use a
  plain `python` when the `py` launcher was missing.

- **Restart only when the cable needs it.** After installing VB-Cable, Soundboard
  checks whether Windows has brought the CABLE devices up. Usually it has and you
  carry on; if Windows needs a restart first, the installer offers *Restart now*, and
  the setup guide shows a Restart button instead of offering to install the cable
  again (installing over a cable that's waiting for a restart is what VB-Audio warns
  against).
- **Sounds only.** The *send* box next to My mic (also in Settings → General and
  the setup guide's mic page) decides whether your voice goes out with the sounds.
  Unticked, others hear only the sounds; the mic stays open so the meter, the tests
  and live voice-to-speech keep working. The Record-6s test knows about it.
- **Installer: pick what you want.** A page of tick boxes: the virtual cable,
  M4A/AAC/video support (installs FFmpeg with winget, offered only when it's
  missing), the retro voice effect and live voice-to-speech add-ons, and a Desktop
  shortcut. The app also finds ffmpeg in winget's Links folder, so m4a works right
  after installing without a restart.
- **README:** a plain-English *Get started* section first; the technical details
  moved under *Advanced*.
- **Ad blocking in the browser tab.** Requests are filtered by Brave's adblock engine
  (new `adblock` dependency) using the EasyList, EasyPrivacy and uBlock Origin lists,
  which are downloaded in the background, cached and refreshed every four days. On
  YouTube a script strips the ad fields out of the player data, the same way uBlock
  Origin's json-prune scriptlet does. If an ad gets through anyway, it's muted, jumped
  to its end and skipped, so it never reaches your mic.
- Push-to-talk keys are injected with `SendInput` (modifiers and key in one call)
  instead of the legacy `keybd_event`. A hotkey another program owns is reported the
  moment registration fails (a signal from the hotkey thread) rather than on a timer,
  and a hotkey thread that fails to start is logged instead of silently ignored.
- A settings save that fails (disk full, antivirus lock) shows once in the status line
  instead of raising inside a timer. Closing the window stops the tick timers and any
  test-capture stream still open.
- **Package layout.** The code is now the `soundboard` package (`soundboard/ui/` for
  the window, widgets, dialogs and panel pieces; `main.py` stays as the launcher), with
  `pyproject.toml` (metadata, entry point, ruff and pytest settings) and `build.ps1`
  to make a self-contained `dist\Soundboard\Soundboard.exe` with PyInstaller.
- **Settings can't be lost.** `config.json` carries a version number and migrations,
  every save keeps the last three good copies, and a damaged file is set aside and the
  newest backup used instead of silently resetting to defaults. Sounds inside the
  library are stored by file name, so `%APPDATA%\Soundboard` can be moved or restored.
- **Browser audio path rebuilt.** Page audio is now captured by an AudioWorklet on
  Chromium's audio thread (ScriptProcessor stays as a fallback for pages whose CSP
  forbids it) and streamed to the app as raw 16-bit PCM over a WebSocket on
  127.0.0.1 with a per-launch secret: no more base64 inside JSON over QWebChannel,
  and no decoding on the UI thread. Embedded players in iframes are captured too
  (when two frames play at once the first keeps the mic until it goes quiet). Stop
  all pauses media in every frame. The mini-player is only polled while the tab is
  visible. The address bar accepts ports, paths and `localhost`.
- **Lighter UI.** The mouse-wheel guard is installed on the dropdowns, sliders and
  number boxes themselves instead of on the whole application, where it ran a Python
  call for every event of every object (mouse moves, paints, the web view's stream).
  The red mic-check banner pulses with an opacity animation instead of rewriting its
  stylesheet 30 times a second. Importing, reordering or deleting a sound updates the
  pad grid in place instead of recreating every pad. Sound lookups are a dict.
- **Faster starts, half the RAM.** Each sound is decoded once and kept in
  `%APPDATA%\Soundboard\cache\` as int16 at 48 kHz; after that a sound loads by reading
  one file instead of decoding and resampling. In memory a 4-minute song is 46 MB
  instead of 92. Orphaned cache files are pruned at start; the folder is safe to delete.
- Only the first 15 minutes of a file are decoded (a two-hour podcast used to be read
  in full and then cut). ffmpeg decodes get a 2-minute timeout instead of hanging the
  import forever.
- Importing a video (or m4a/aac/wma) stores a FLAC of its audio instead of copying the
  whole file into the library. Recorded clips are FLAC too (were float WAV, 4× bigger).
- Importing a file that's already in the library is refused ("already in your library
  as …") using a content fingerprint, including the same file twice in one drop.
- Browser **Record clip** spools to disk as it records instead of holding up to 700 MB
  of chunks in RAM at the 15-minute cap.
- Resampled copies for devices not at 48 kHz are now an LRU cache capped at 512 MB.
- **Log file**: `%APPDATA%\Soundboard\soundboard.log` (rotating). Unhandled exceptions,
  worker-thread errors and Qt warnings all land there; a crash on the UI thread also
  shows one dialog with the path. Previously, under `pythonw.exe`, they vanished.
- **Audio streams are self-healing**: a callback that stops (headset unplugged, sample
  rate changed in Windows, PC back from sleep) is detected within about a second and
  the stream reopened; a device that failed to open is retried every 5 s. An exception
  inside an audio callback no longer kills the stream: it's logged once, the block is
  silent, and audio continues.
- **Drop-outs are counted** (from the driver's own underflow/overflow flags) and shown
  in the status line and in Settings → General. New **Audio buffering: Low / Safer**
  option for devices that crackle at low latency.
- The audio thread no longer waits on the UI: the voice list is an immutable snapshot
  (no lock in the callbacks), the interpreter's thread switch interval is 1 ms instead
  of 5, and the garbage collector runs far less often.
- Fixed: with no headphone device open, **Preview** in the Edit dialog played the sound
  out to Discord / the game.
- Fixed: the resampled-audio cache could serve a stale block if a freed array was
  reallocated at the same address (only when a device isn't at 48 kHz).
- Fixed: a hotkey of `ctrl++` (the + key) never parsed.
- EQ runs entirely in float32 (no per-block float64 round trip).
- Dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt`; `requirements-dev.txt` adds ruff and
  pytest. New `tests/` suite (66 tests, no audio device needed) and `ruff.toml`.

- **Browser hotkeys** (global, work in-game): record start/stop (Ctrl+Alt+R), save
  the last 15s (Ctrl+Alt+C), play/pause (Ctrl+Alt+P), LIVE on/off (Ctrl+Alt+L).
  Record/save hotkeys confirm with a short beep in your headphones only.
- **⚙ Settings window** (top right) with every hotkey in one place, themes and window
  options. Giving a key to one action takes it off any other action or sound.
- **Themes**: Dark, Light, Toxic (green) and Ocean (blue). They switch instantly and
  are remembered.
- **New logo**: a microphone whose head is an equalizer, on a gradient. Shown in the
  header (in the theme's colours), the taskbar and the shortcuts (`make_icon.py`
  regenerates `soundboard.ico`).

- **🍃 Lite mode** for the Browser tab (on by default), to keep it light while you
  play. When something starts playing, the page is swapped for a small player (title,
  time, ⏪10s ⏯ 10s⏩ ⏭), so nothing is drawn or decoded as video, and YouTube drops to
  144p. **Show page** brings the page back to pick something else. Measured on an HD
  video: browser CPU roughly halved (40% → 20% of a core), audio unchanged.

- Opening the Browser tab no longer makes the window vanish and reappear. The window
  is now GPU-rendered from the start (`QT_WIDGETS_RHI`), so Qt doesn't have to
  rebuild it when the browser first appears.
- The "Only me — click to go live" button label is no longer cut off.

- Only one Soundboard can run. Opening it again brings the existing window to the
  front instead of starting another copy (repeated launches had piled up dozens of
  `pythonw.exe` processes). The lock is a named mutex, which Windows frees if the app crashes.
- Browser → mic no longer stutters every few seconds. Chromium's audio clock and the
  output devices' clocks drift apart, so the browser buffers now track the drift
  (speed nudged by at most 2%, no clicks) instead of running dry.
- Quiet passages in browser audio are streamed too, so sound after a pause in the
  video isn't delayed by re-buffering.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-26

First version.

- Sound pads with import (button, drag-and-drop, folders), search, reorder, colours, sizes.
- Per-sound hotkeys, volume, loop and press modes (restart / overlap / toggle).
- Global hotkeys use Windows' `RegisterHotKey`, so they never sit in the input path
  (no stuck keys or input freezes). Warns when another program already owns a hotkey.
- Mixes mic + sounds into a virtual cable at each device's native rate, with soxr resampling.
- Works on any setup: virtual cables (VB-Cable, A/B, Voicemeeter) are detected and
  paired automatically, and the card shows the real device names. With no cable, a
  one-time setup step offers an Install button.
- `install.bat` / `install.ps1`: one-click setup (Python, packages, shortcuts, virtual
  cable). `install-vbcable.ps1` downloads VB-Cable from the official site and checks its
  signature before running it.
- **Browser → mic** tab: a built-in browser whose audio goes live through your mic
  (LIVE toggle, own volume, hear-it-myself). **Record clip** and **Clip last 15s** turn
  what played into new sound pads. Stop all pauses it, and auto push-to-talk covers it.
- Headphone monitoring, loudness levelling, soft limiter.
- Transport bar: play/pause, stop, seek.
- Global stop-all and pause-all hotkeys, auto push-to-talk. Push-to-talk always releases
  the exact key it pressed.
- Volume controls with plain-language labels and typed % (up to 1000%).
- 7-band EQ for voice, sounds or both, with presets.
- Test mode: live mic-output monitor with red banner, and a 6-second record/playback
  check of the real cable output that reports voice/sound presence and balance.
- Simple main panel with a plain-English "How it works" card. Devices, sound options,
  EQ and hotkeys sit under a collapsible ⚙ Advanced section.
- The mouse wheel scrolls the panel and never changes dropdowns, sliders or number boxes.
- Virtual cables are excluded from the mic list, which prevents a feedback loop.
