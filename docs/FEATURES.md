# Everything Onion Board does

The full list. The [README](../README.md) has the short version and how to get started.

- **Pads:** add by button, drag-and-drop (files or folders), or by dropping files into
  the sounds folder (**Sounds folder** opens it; they join the board by themselves). Plays mp3, wav, ogg,
  flac, m4a and more, and pulls the audio out of video files. Search, reorder,
  resize, set colours.
- **Categories:** the tabs above the pads (the *+* after the last tab makes one). Right-click a
  pad → *Categories* to put it in any number of them; right-click a category to
  rename, export or delete it. The in-game overlay shows the same category, and
  its **R** key (numpad **\***) switches to the next one. Right-click a category to
  give it a random-sound hotkey, or to *Play them all* (in order or shuffled). With
  *Use hotkeys per category* (Settings → Hotkeys) each category is its own set of
  keys: one key, a different sound per category.
- **Remove can be undone:** *Removed “…” · Undo* stays up for 10 seconds. After that
  the sound waits in **Recently deleted** (the *Backup* menu, or the bin button that
  shows while it holds sounds) for 30 days, and *Bring back* returns it exactly as it
  was. Only when it ages out does its audio file go to the Recycle Bin.
- **Backup / share (*Backup* button, or Settings → General):** *Export everything*
  writes every sound (picture, effects, hotkey, categories) and your settings to
  one `.zip`; import it on a new PC (which audio devices and where sounds go stay
  per PC). A category or a single pad exports as a sound pack to share; importing
  skips sounds you already have. *Import from another soundboard* brings sounds over
  from Soundpad, Resanance, Soundux or EXP Soundboard. The format is a plain
  zip of JSON and the original audio files — see
  [BACKUP-FORMAT.md](BACKUP-FORMAT.md).
- **Per sound:** global hotkey (works in-game) or MIDI pad, volume, loop, what
  pressing again does (restart / overlap / toggle), **Solo** (stops every other
  sound first), **Queue** (waits for the sounds playing to finish; right-click any
  pad → *Play next* does it once), **Only others hear it** (not in your
  headphones), a **wait** before it plays, a **cooldown** against spamming and
  **Hold to play** (plays only while you hold its key or pad down, like an air horn).
- **Effects on any sound** (right-click a pad → **Effects…**, or the *Effects* tab
  of **Edit…**): speed and pitch (separately, or together like a record player
  with *Tape mode*), **trim** (drag the start and end on the sound's waveform, or
  type exact times — keep one line out of a 4-minute video), a 7-band EQ, a boost
  up to +36 dB that clips on purpose,
  play backwards, and every voice effect (echo, reverb, distortion, radio, robot,
  add-on effects too). One-click presets: **Ear rape**, Bass boosted,
  Slowed + reverb, Nightcore, Chipmunk, Demon, Fast / Slow-mo (same pitch), Old
  radio, Reversed. *Preview* plays it to you only; **Save** changes that pad,
  **Save as new sound** keeps the original and adds the edited version as its own
  pad. Pads with effects show **FX**; *Reset* goes back to the original. The
  original file is never changed.
- **Your mic on or off:** send your voice with the sounds, or sounds only.
- **Where your sounds go** (Setup → Devices → *Send to others through*, also in
  Settings → Audio): **the virtual cable** (the default; the installer offers it, and
  Discord or the game uses its *CABLE Output* as a mic), **another device** (any output
  but your headphones: Voicemeeter, a mixer, a capture card, a second sound card, any
  output OBS captures as an *Audio Output Capture*) or **nowhere** (only you hear your
  sounds, and the stream output if you set one). With another device the app never puts
  the cable back, never asks you to install it, and the header pill turns green once
  it's sending. With nowhere nothing nags. The choice is per PC and isn't in backups.
- **Stream output for OBS** (Settings → Audio → *Stream output*): what others hear,
  without the voice chat shaping, on a device of its own (a second virtual cable such
  as VB-Cable A+B, or any output you don't listen on). In OBS add it as an *Audio
  Output Capture* (or, for a cable, *Audio Input Capture* of its Output end) and your
  sounds and screen triggers are their own track, with their own volume. Your voice
  goes with them unless you untick it.
- **Transport bar:** play/pause, stop, a seek slider, and **speed & pitch while
  it plays** (the `1x` button: 0.25×–2×, ±12 semitones, keep the pitch or not).
  That's for listening and isn't saved; use Effects to keep a version.
- **Any window size:** less important controls tuck away as it gets smaller and come
  back when it grows. Small enough (below roughly 440 × 380) it becomes a mini
  player with your pads and the play / stop controls, down to 260 × 120.
- **Global hotkeys** (set in **⚙ Settings → Hotkeys**, the overlay key in
  **⚙ Settings → Overlay**; all work in-game):
  - Stop all, and pause/resume all.
  - A random sound (from the category showing), the last sound again, next /
    previous category (beeps tell you which), sounds louder / quieter, your mic on /
    off, the voice changer on / off or only while a key is held, and **all hotkeys
    off / on** for when you need to type.
  - **In-game overlay** (by default the key left of <kbd>1</kbd>: <kbd>`</kbd> on a
    US keyboard; where that key types a letter, like ö or ñ, it's Alt + that key):
    a small panel of your sounds over the game. Number keys play them, and the game keeps your mouse
    and keyboard.
  - Auto push-to-talk: holds your game's PTT key while a sound plays.
  - **Instant replay:** set its key and the last 30 seconds of everything your PC
    plays (a friend in Discord, the game, a video; not Onion Board's own sounds)
    are kept in memory. Press it after something funny and it becomes a pad.
    Nothing is saved or sent anywhere until you press it; clear the key to switch
    it off. Needs Windows 11 or Windows 10 build 20348+.
  - Hotkeys can beep in your headphones (only you hear it), so you know they
    worked.
- **Radio tab:** internet radio from all over the world, from the free
  [Radio Browser](https://www.radio-browser.info) directory. Click a dot on the
  world map to tune in (hover one for its country, genres, quality and how popular
  it is; drag to move, scroll to zoom: zoomed in, the cities and towns with stations
  are named), or search by name, genre, country or city. The
  map's **HD** button swaps it for a 3D globe you can spin (heavier: it runs a web
  engine); **2D** on the globe goes back. Star stations for
  *★ Favorites*. It plays in your headphones, goes out through
  your mic when you press **LIVE**, and can *Record* or save the *Last 15s* as a pad.
- **Voice tab:** voice changer (pitch, robot, radio, echo, reverb, distortion,
  8-bit bitcrusher, plus add-on effects; it starts off every time the app
  opens, and a big ON / OFF button shows which it is), text-to-speech with Windows' built-in
  voices or your own (*More options → Custom voices*: a TTS server on your PC such as
  Kokoro or AllTalk — any OpenAI-style `/v1/audio/speech` address — a TTS program, or
  Piper voice packs dropped into the voices folder), and **live voice-to-speech**:
  press *Start talking as the voice* and each sentence you say is spoken by a
  computer voice instead of yours. Speech recognition runs on your PC (the first time, the Voice tab's *Install speech
  recognition* button downloads it, about 300 MB; needs Python 3.12+).
  *Speak in* makes the voice say it in Chinese, Spanish, French, German or
  Russian: talk in English and it's translated on your PC. Each language is an
  add-on you download only if you pick it (65–195 MB), and it needs that
  language's Windows voice (Settings → Speech → Add voices, free).
- **Triggers tab:** plays a sound when a picture shows up in your game: a
  game's "YOU DIED", a rare spawn, a queue popping. It's the
  [Onion Watch](https://github.com/Onion-Alien/onion-watch) add-on: the tab's
  *Get Onion Watch* button downloads it from its GitHub release (checked against
  the SHA-256 GitHub lists) and it appears right there, no restart. Pick the
  game's window (it's watched even while other windows cover it, and two copies of
  a game are told apart) or a screen, cut the thing to watch for straight out of
  it (or paste a Win+Shift+S cut, or add a file), pick sounds from your board,
  and choose the wait, how soon it may play again and how close a match must be,
  with the live match % next to it. A trigger plays once each time the picture
  appears, or rings until you stop it. Its sounds play through the board like a
  pad; a ringing one loops in your headphones. Triggers from before the add-on
  (Onion Board 1.4 and older) carry over as they were. When a newer Onion Watch
  is out, the tab offers it (only while *Check once a day* is
  ticked). *Remove Onion Watch…* in its *More* menu uninstalls it (after asking);
  your triggers are kept for when you get it again.
  Everything happens on your PC: the screen is never saved or sent anywhere. If
  a game still shows up black, set it to Borderless or Windowed fullscreen.
- **Mute my mic while a sound plays** (Setup → *Who's listening*): others hear
  only the sound, clean, and your mic comes back the moment it ends. Or the
  opposite, *While I talk, lower my sounds*.
- **Volumes:** sounds → them, your voice → them, your headphones. Exact % boxes go
  up to 1000%; a soft limiter stops hard clipping. "Level volumes" makes every
  sound equally loud.
- **7-band equalizer** on your voice, your sounds, or both, with presets.
- **Test mode:**
  - **Hear what they hear:** your mic plus the sounds exactly as others get them
    (a red banner shows while it's on).
  - **Record 6s → play back:** records what goes out (the cable's output end, or the
    mix sent to another device), plays it back, and reports whether your voice and
    sounds are in it and whether the balance is off. Not available when sounds go
    nowhere.
- **Search YouTube and SoundCloud** from the Sounds tab: Enter in *Search sounds*
  lists results (thumbnail, title, length) in place of the pads; *Play* plays one
  once, *Add* keeps it as a pad (only the audio is downloaded, via
  [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)). TikTok, Instagram and most other
  sites have no search without an account, so paste a link to the video instead.
  YouTube's m4a/webm audio needs FFmpeg, like a dropped m4a file does. Settings →
  Updates has *Update now* and *Reset downloader* for when downloads start
  failing, and an opt-in box to update yt-dlp from PyPI automatically (off by
  default).
- **⚙ Settings:** 31 themes in four groups — Classic (Dark, Light, true-black
  Midnight, High Contrast…), Colourful, Wild (Synthwave, Hacker, Amber Terminal…)
  and Meme (Flashbang, Deep Fried, Retro 98, Comic Sans…); they switch live —
  plus hotkeys, overlay, window and audio options. A category sidebar keeps every
  page visible: **Privacy & security** groups online permissions and Offline mode;
  **Connection** holds Direct, proxy and Tor; **Data & quality** holds download
  sizes, radio quality and search extras; **Updates** holds update scheduling
  and maintenance; **General** holds window, startup, backups and *Start over*;
  **Add-ons & help** holds Onion Watch, feedback and support; **About** holds the
  version and links. The other categories are Appearance, Audio, Hotkeys, Overlay
  and Remote. Changes apply immediately.
- **MIDI pads and macro keypads:** a pad controller (Akai LPD8 / MPD, Launchpad,
  any USB MIDI keyboard) works without extra software: set a hotkey and hit a pad
  instead of pressing a key. Pads work for sounds, stop / pause, random sounds and
  the overlay. A controller is only opened while a hotkey uses it, so your music
  app can have your other MIDI gear. On Windows only one program can use a MIDI
  device at a time: if one is busy, Onion Board says so and picks it up once it's
  free. A cheap USB macro keypad works too: set its keys to F13–F24 (keys nothing
  else uses) and use those as hotkeys.
- **Stream Deck and scripts (optional, off by default):** Settings → Remote →
  *Remote control* lets programs on this PC play your sounds: a Stream Deck
  (Bitfocus Companion, Touch Portal, its website buttons), AutoHotkey or a script.
  It only listens on this PC and needs the key shown there (*Copy link* gives a
  ready-made "play a random sound" link). Besides playing and stopping sounds it can
  mute you (a panic button), switch the voice changer and mic, change the volume and
  category and save the instant replay; `/api/help` lists it all. New to it? The
  **Streamer guide** there walks through Stream Deck keys, channel points and chat
  commands (Streamer.bot), and **Copy AI prompt** gives ChatGPT / Claude everything
  it needs (the links, your sounds) to set up whatever tools you use with you.
- **Runs in the background:** closing the window keeps it in the tray (hotkeys and
  the overlay keep working; right-click the tray icon → *Quit*). Optionally
  **starts when you sign in**, straight to the tray (Settings → General).
- **Updates itself:** once a day it checks GitHub for a new version (untick it in
  Settings → Updates). *Update now* downloads it, checks it's the file GitHub lists,
  and on *Restart now* installs it and reopens the app, keeping your sounds and
  settings. Nothing is downloaded until you click.

## How it works

With the virtual cable (the default way):

```
🎤 your mic ── send ✓ / ✗ ──┐
                            ├─►  Onion Board mixes them  ─►  CABLE Input ═══ pipe ═══► CABLE Output
🔊 your sounds ─────────────┘                                                          (Discord / game mic)
```

The virtual cable is a free audio driver that works like a pipe: Onion Board plays
into one end, and Discord or the game uses the other end as a microphone. You hear
the sounds in your own headphones separately.

Not using the cable? Setup → Devices → **Send to others through** → *Another
device* sends the same mix into whatever output you pick instead (Voicemeeter, a
mixer, a capture card, OBS), or *Nowhere* keeps it to your headphones and the
stream output.
