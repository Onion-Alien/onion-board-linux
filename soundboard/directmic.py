"""The mic effect: what others hear goes straight into your real mic, no virtual cable.
Setup -> Devices -> Send to others through -> "Straight into my mic".

How: a small Windows audio effect (native/directmic/obmic.cpp, an "APO" like Equalizer
APO's) runs inside Windows' audio engine on one microphone, in front of every app that
records it. Discord and games keep using the normal mic, so there's nothing to pick
there, and nothing is injected into any game. Soundpad works this way.

Board <-> effect: a shared file, %ProgramData%\\OnionBoard\\MicPlugin\\ring2.bin (the
folder lets the audio engine's account and signed-in users read and write it):

  header (HEADER bytes; little-endian; offsets in bytes)
  0   u32 magic "OBMC"          4   u32 version (2)
  8   u32 rate (48000)          12  u32 capacity: frames in the main ring (power of 2)
  16  u64 frames written (board)                24  u64 board's last write (GetTickCount64)
  32  u32 enabled (board)       36  u32 mode (board): 0 add, 1 replace
  40  f32 gain (board)          44  f32 mic gain (board, add mode; 0 = muted)
  48  u32 mic capacity: frames in the clean-mic ring (power of 2)
  52  i32 publisher: the slot owner writing the clean mic
  56  u64 clean-mic frames written (effect)    64  u32 the clean mic's rate
  68  u32 lead (board): ring frames the effect reads behind the board (0 = 20 ms)
  72  u64 the clean mic's last block (GetTickCount64)
  80  u32 the running effect's version
  84  u32 the process id of the board writing (another board backs off; the effect
      doesn't read it)
  256 SLOTS slots of 64 bytes, one per app recording the mic (SLOT below)
  HEADER: f32[capacity] what others hear, mono, at `rate`
  then:   f32[mic capacity][2] the clean mic, at the mic's rate

The effect publishes the clean mic (after the mic's own driver effect, before anything
of the board's); the board's mic comes from there, so its meter, mic check and voice
changer never hear its own sounds come back. Each block of clean mic in, the board
renders the same stretch of what others hear and writes it out: it runs on the mic's
clock, so the two never drift apart. In replace mode (the default) that is the whole
send mix, your processed voice included, and the effect puts it in place of the mic
(about 20 ms later); add mode adds only the sounds on top of the mic. Whenever the
board is quiet or late, the effect crossfades back to the plain mic. Nobody recording
the mic: the effect doesn't run, and the board keeps time on its own clock.

Installing needs admin once (Windows' prompt): `install()` runs this app again as admin
(`--direct-mic install <endpoint>`), which copies the effect DLL to Program Files,
registers it, puts it on the mic (keeping any effect the mic's driver had, which the
effect then runs first) and restarts Windows' audio service. `uninstall()` puts every
mic back as it was. The DLL that's installed is always this app's own copy, never a path
from the command line, so the admin step can't be pointed at another DLL.
