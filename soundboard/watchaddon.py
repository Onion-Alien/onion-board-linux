"""Onion Watch, the add-on behind the Triggers tab: its newest release, downloading
it and installing it into %APPDATA%\\OnionBoard\\modules\\onion-watch.

Nothing here runs until the user asks for it: the tab's *Get Onion Watch* button,
or its *Update* button once it's installed and the app's own daily update check
(only while "Tell me when a new version is out" is ticked) found a newer one. The
file is taken only from the project's own github.com/…/releases/download/ link,
over HTTPS, and kept only if it matches the SHA-256 GitHub lists for it
(updates.fetch). Then it's checked and unpacked (modules.install_zip) and the
Triggers tab loads it.

ONIONBOARD_ONION_WATCH_ZIP=<path to an OnionWatch-module.zip> makes both use that
file instead of GitHub, to try a build before it's released.

"Get and update add-ons" switched off in Settings > Privacy & security stops all of
it (net.FeatureOff); the daily check then skips itself without a word.
