"""*Did you know?* tips: one short tip per start, about a feature a new user won't find
alone, each with a *Show me* that opens the right place. Shown only after the setup
guide is done, at most once a day, never while a game is up (the overlay open or a
fullscreen program in front), and never again once seen. Settings → General →
*Show tips* turns them off. The window (ui/mainwindow.py) shows the bar and does
the *Show me*; this module only picks."""
