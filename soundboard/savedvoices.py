"""Your own voices for the voice changer: mixes saved under a name (Fine-tune ->
"Save as a voice"), and the ones deleted lately so they can be brought back.

They live in %APPDATA%\\OnionBoard\\voices.json, not in config.json: an older version
rewrites the voice changer's settings without the fields it doesn't know, and this is
a file it never opens, so going back a version loses none of them.

The folder is looked up on every call (library.APP_DIR), so tests that point the
