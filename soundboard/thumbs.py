"""Pad pictures: a small JPEG per sound in THUMBS_DIR.

Where they come from: the video thumbnail yt-dlp saves next to a downloaded link
(YouTube, TikTok and the other sites it supports), the cover art / first frame of an
imported file (needs ffmpeg), or any image the user picks, drops or pastes on a pad.

Everything here uses QImage, which is safe off the UI thread (the download and
import workers call store()). Only pixmap() and fitted() need the UI thread; they
read the file on a worker thread and answer None until it's in.
