"""Local control API: lets a Stream Deck (its "API request" / website actions, Bitfocus
Companion, Touch Portal…), AutoHotkey or a script play pads.

Off unless turned on in Settings → Remote. It listens on 127.0.0.1 only, on
Config.api_port, and every request must carry the token shown in Settings, as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`, an `X-Token: <token>` header, or `?token=<token>`
for tools that can only open a URL. The token is random, stays in config.json (a
Stream Deck button has to keep working after a restart, so it can't change every
launch), is never exported with a backup, and is never logged; Settings can make a
new one. Requests whose Host isn't this PC's loopback are refused (DNS rebinding),
and no CORS headers are sent, so a web page can't read anything back.

Every endpoint takes GET or POST and answers JSON (ENDPOINTS below is the list;
/api/help returns it, so a script or an AI assistant can look it up):

    /api/status                  version, what's playing, category, live / voice / mic
    /api/sounds                  [{id, name, hotkey, categories, color, playing}]
    /api/categories              ["Memes", ...]
    /api/play?id=… or ?name=…    play a pad (name: exact, any case)
    /api/stop?id=… or ?name=…    stop one sound;  /api/stop alone stops everything
    /api/pause                   pause everything / resume
    /api/random[?category=…]     a random sound (default: the category showing;
                                 category= with nothing after it: any sound)
    /api/last                    play the last sound again
    /api/category?name=… / ?step=next|prev   show a category (name= blank: All)
    /api/volume?set=0-100 / ?step=up|down    the sounds' volume
    /api/live, /api/voice, /api/mic [?on=1|0|toggle]
                                 the Live / Muted switch, the voice changer, "others
                                 hear my mic" (no on=: toggle)
    /api/replay                  save the instant replay as a pad
    /api/speed?set=0.25-2 / ?step=up|down [&keep=1|0|toggle]
    /api/pitch?set=-12-12 / ?step=up|down
                                 the live speed / pitch of every sound (keep: speed
                                 changes leave the pitch alone)
    /api/effects?bass=6&echo=0.3… / ?preset=Canyon / ?reset=1
                                 the live effects on every sound
    /api/reset                   back to 1x, no pitch change, no effects
    /api/mode[?simple=game|?set=discord]   who's listening: a sound mode (Game, Voice
                                 chat, Clean, Advanced) or one exact voice chat mode
    /api/stations?list=popular|favorites|recent|search[&q=…]   radio stations
    /api/radio?id=… / ?on=1|0|toggle         play a station / play or stop the radio
    /api/radio_random, /api/radio_star[?id=…], /api/radio_live, /api/radio_hear,
    /api/radio_volume            the Radio tab's other controls
    /api/help                    this list

The same server, given `lan=True`, is what "remote" add-ons such as Onion Pocket
get (soundboard.ui.remotehost): it listens on this PC's address on the home network
instead, with the add-on's own key, a shorter list of actions, and a page served at
/ without a key (the page holds nothing; Onion Pocket hands the phone its key in the
link's #fragment, which browsers never send). It answers only addresses on the local
network, takes the key only in a header (never ?token=, which would end up in a
browser's history), and an address that gets the key wrong FAIL_LIMIT times in a row
is ignored for LOCK_S seconds. It never listens on a network Windows calls Public
(a café's Wi-Fi), whatever Windows Firewall says (soundboard.netcategory). Either
server keeps at most MAX_CONNECTIONS open at once (PEER_CONNECTIONS from one address).

On the home network the key needn't travel at all: a request can instead carry
`X-Sig: <unix time>.<nonce>.<HMAC-SHA256(key, "<time>.<nonce>.<METHOD> <path>")>`
(base64url, no padding), where <path> is the request target as sent ("/api/play?id=…").
Someone reading the Wi-Fi's traffic sees only signatures: each is good for one request,
within SIG_WINDOW_S of this PC's clock, and a nonce is never taken twice. A wrong key's
401 carries `now`, this PC's clock, so a phone whose clock is off can sign again.
Onion Pocket signs from the version that sees `RemoteHost.signed_requests`; the plain
key header still works for older ones.

The HTTP side runs on its own thread; each request is handed to the UI thread
(`RemoteControl.request`) and answered from there, so it never touches the
window's state from another thread.

I use Onion Board, a free Windows soundboard. Its "Remote control" feature lets other \
programs on my PC control it over a small local HTTP API. Please help me set up my \
streaming tools to use it. Ask me first which tools I use (Stream Deck, Streamer.bot, \
Touch Portal, Bitfocus Companion, SAMMI, Mix It Up, AutoHotkey, a macro pad…) and what \
I want the buttons / triggers to do, then give me exact click-by-click steps for each \
one, with the full URLs ready to copy.

HOW THE API WORKS
- Address: {base}  (it only listens on this PC: tools on another computer or phone \
can't reach it, so they must run on this PC)
- Every request needs my key, as ?token=KEY in the URL (simplest: works anywhere a URL \
can be opened), an X-Token: KEY header, or Authorization: Bearer KEY.
- GET or POST both work; every answer is JSON. The Host header must be 127.0.0.1 or \
localhost.
- Sound and category names must match exactly (any case) and be URL-encoded: a space is \
%20, & is %26. A wrong name answers 404 with "did_you_mean".
- Errors: 401 = wrong / missing key, 404 = no such sound / category, 409 = not \
loaded yet, 503 = the app was busy (safe to retry). If nothing answers at all, Onion \
Board isn't running or "Enable remote control" is off.
- Test it first by opening {base}/api/status?token={key} in a browser.
{key_note}
ENDPOINTS
{endpoints}

EXAMPLES
- Play a sound: {base}/api/play?name={quote(example)}&token={key}
- {rnd}
- Stop everything: {base}/api/stop?token={key}
- Panic button (others hear nothing until pressed again): \
{base}/api/live?on=toggle&token={key}
- Voice changer on / off: {base}/api/voice?on=toggle&token={key}

WHERE EACH TOOL SENDS A REQUEST (as far as I know — correct me if a tool has changed)
- Elgato Stream Deck app: System → Website action, paste the URL, tick "GET request in \
background" so no browser opens. (Or a free "API Request" plugin from the Marketplace.)
- Streamer.bot: an Action with the sub-action Core → Network → Fetch URL; triggers such \
as Twitch → Channel Reward → Reward Redemption, chat commands, cheers / bits, raids, \
follows. Fetch URL runs in the background.
- Touch Portal: the "HTTP Get" action (or a web-request plugin).
- Bitfocus Companion: the "Generic HTTP" connection, a GET action with the full URL \
(Companion must run on this PC).
- SAMMI / Mix It Up: their "HTTP request" / "Web Request" command, GET.
- AutoHotkey v2: whr := ComObject("WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1"), \
whr.Open("GET", url), whr.Send() — bound to a key.
- Anything else that can open a URL or run a command: curl -s "URL".

MY SETUP RIGHT NOW
- Port: {port}
- Categories: {", ".join(cfg.categories) or "(none yet: every sound is in All)"}
- Sounds ({len(sounds)}):
{chr(10).join(names) or "- (none yet)"}

Keep the steps beginner-friendly. Don't suggest exposing the API to the internet, \
port-forwarding it or running it on another machine: it's meant for this PC only.
