"""Getting Tor: the Tor Project's Tor Expert Bundle, downloaded when the user asks for
it (Settings > Connection > Get Tor, or the installer's "Private
connection (Tor)" box, which runs `OnionBoard.exe --get-tor`). The app doesn't ship it.

The tarball comes from dist.torproject.org through net.urlopen (feature
"tor_download", with its own switch in Settings), so it follows the Connection setting
(a proxy, or a Tor that's already here when updating it). It's
checked against the SHA-256 pinned below before anything is unpacked, and only the
parts the app runs are kept, in %APPDATA%\\OnionBoard\\tor\\bin (about 28 MB):
tor.exe, lyrebird.exe (obfs4 / Snowflake bridges), pt_config.json (the built-in
bridge lines) and the licence texts. Skipped: the GeoIP databases (only needed to pick
exit countries), conjure-client.exe and tor-gencert.exe. scripts/fetch_tor.py unpacks
the same files into vendor/tor for running from source.

To move to a newer Tor release: take the new tarball's line from that release's
sha256sums-signed-build.txt, verify that file's signature once
(gpg --verify sha256sums-signed-build.txt.asc, signed by the Tor Browser developers'
key EF6E 286D DA85 EA2A 4BA7 DE68 4E2C 6E87 9329 8290), then update VERSION and
SHA256. A copy with an older stamp is offered as "Update Tor" in Settings.
