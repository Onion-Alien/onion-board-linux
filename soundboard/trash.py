"""Recently deleted: removed sounds and forgotten programs, kept for a while so they
can be brought back.

A removed sound's audio and picture move into %APPDATA%\\OnionBoard\\deleted\\, and
its pad (name, volume, hotkey, effects, categories…) is written to deleted.json
beside them. A forgotten program keeps its volume and "Hear it myself". Entries
older than KEEP_DAYS, or past the newest MAX_ITEMS, go for good: a sound's audio
then goes to the Windows Recycle Bin, as a removal used to straight away.

The folder is looked up on every call (library.APP_DIR), so tests that point the
library somewhere else get their own bin.
