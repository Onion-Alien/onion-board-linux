"""The AI voices to pick from: the built-in ones and the ones you make yourself.

A voice is a blend of speakers from the add-on's voice model plus a formant and a
pitch (see modules/ai-voices/voices.json). The model holds a fixed set of speakers,
so new blends of them need no new download: the app carries the built-in list
(BUILT_IN, the same as the add-on's voices.json) and writes it, with your own voices,
into the installed add-on's voices.json (sync), which its helper reads. An add-on
downloaded before a voice was added gets that voice too.

Your own voices live in %APPDATA%\\OnionBoard\\ai-voices.json, not in config.json
(an older version rewrites the AI voice settings without fields it doesn't know) and
not only in the add-on's folder (updating or removing the add-on replaces that):
