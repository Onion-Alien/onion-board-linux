"""Glue for text-to-speech and live voice-to-speech (no Qt here; the panel adds that).

    typed text ─────────────────────────────┐
    mic ─ VoiceChain.tap ─ ServiceHost ─ "final" text ─┴─ Speaker ─ VoiceSet ─ Engine.play

When live voice translates (a translation add-on), its lines come back already in
that language and are spoken with `live_voice`, a voice that speaks it.

Spoken lines are played like a sound (sid "tts"), so they go to the send device, your
headphones and auto push-to-talk exactly as a pad would. While live voice is on,
the chain can also mute your real voice (`replace`), so others only hear the TTS.
