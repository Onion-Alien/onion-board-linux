"""Which voice chat engine the game you're playing uses, from the files it ships.

A voice SDK comes as its own library in the game's install folder, so the game in
the foreground can be matched to a *Who's listening* mode without touching the
game itself: its .exe path is read with the least access Windows has (the same
query Task Manager makes, which anti-cheat allows), and its install folder is
listed. Nothing is injected, no memory is read, no module list is taken.

    vivoxsdk.dll                      Vivox          (every game shipping it uses it
                                                      for voice; checked on five installs)
    opus_egpv.dll, PhotonVoice*.dll   Photon Voice   (its native Opus build / managed code)
    DissonanceVoip.dll,
    AudioPluginDissonance.dll         Dissonance

Not detectable, so never suggested: Epic Online Services (EOSSDK ships in games that
only use it for accounts or achievements, single-player ones included), Steam voice
(steam_api is in nearly every Steam game), Unreal's built-in voice and Discord.

Better than the game in front: the program actually recording your mic (straight
into my mic) or the virtual cable's far end (Listeners). Windows lists who records
a device the same way it lists who plays (soundboard.appaudio.recording_apps), so a
voice chat app is named by its exe (VOICE_APPS) and a game by the files in its
folder, as above.

The result is a suggestion by the picker, and the mode is switched for you only
when *Pick the mode by itself* is ticked there (`dest["auto"]`).
