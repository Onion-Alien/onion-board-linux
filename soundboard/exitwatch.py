"""Why the last run ended without closing itself.

usage.py only learns *that* a run never reached a clean quit (`running.txt` left
behind). This keeps a small black box while the app runs, so the next start can say
why, in the usage count (`unclean-exit/<version>/<why>`) and in a report saved beside
the crash reports:

- `last-run.json`: when this run started, a heartbeat every HEARTBEAT_S, whether the
  window was frozen at that moment, and whether a quit had started.
- `native-crash.txt`: Python's faulthandler writes every thread's stack here if the
  process dies in native code (an access violation in Qt, PortAudio, a DLL) -- the
  kind of crash that never reaches applog's Python hooks. Emptied at a clean quit.
- Windows' own Application log: an "Application Error" (the exception code and the
  DLL it happened in) or "Application Hang" (Windows closed it as Not Responding)
  for this run's process ID. Read with wevtutil, on this PC only.

The kinds, most certain first: `native-crash`, `windows-error`, `not-responding`,
`while-closing` (a quit started but never finished), `frozen` (the window was stuck
at the last heartbeat: probably ended in Task Manager), `pc-restarted` (the PC
started again since the last heartbeat: a power cut, a forced restart, a blue
screen), `ended` (none of those: ended in Task Manager, or killed without a trace).
