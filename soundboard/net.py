"""Every outgoing connection the app makes, in one place (Settings >
Connection), so all of it can go through a proxy with nothing leaking around it.

Modes:
  "direct"  connect straight to each site, as before.
  "proxy"   everything goes through the proxy in cfg.net_proxy:
            socks5h://host:port (socks5:// and a bare host:port mean the same) or
            http://host:port, either with user:password@ if it needs one.
  "tor"     everything goes through the app's own Tor (soundboard.tor), a SOCKS port
            on 127.0.0.1 that's only there once Tor has connected. A connection
            made before that waits for it (up to TOR_WAIT_S), then fails: it never
            goes direct. soundboard.tor plugs itself in with set_tor_gate().

How each kind of traffic gets here:
  * urllib (updates, yt-dlp updater, Myinstants, translation models, add-ons, custom
    voices): urlopen() below, whose connections are made by connect().
  * Qt Multimedia's FFmpeg (radio streams), yt-dlp (and the ffmpeg it may start), Qt's
    network managers (Radio Browser, thumbnails) and child processes (pip, the live
    voice helper): a small HTTP proxy on 127.0.0.1 (the relay) that needs a per-launch
    secret and makes its onward connections with connect(). FFmpeg reads its address
    from the http_proxy environment variable, so a stream's redirects, HLS playlists
    and segments and ICY titles all go through it too.
connect() hands host names to the proxy unresolved (no DNS lookup on this PC), and
fails with a readable ProxyError rather than ever falling back to a direct
connection. Loopback (127.0.0.1, ::1, localhost) always stays direct.

Switches (Settings > Privacy & security): every feature that goes online (FEATURES)
can be switched off, and Offline mode switches them all off. Every request names its
feature (urlopen(feature=…), connect(feature=…), the relay's user name), and one that
doesn't, or names one that's off, is refused with FeatureOff before anything is
looked up or connected, in every mode. That's why the relay runs in Direct mode too:
FFmpeg and Qt connect from C++, and the relay is the only place they can be stopped.

Every connection made here, and every one refused, is listed in soundboard.netlog
(Settings > Connection > Network activity), in memory only.
