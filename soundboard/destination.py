"""Destination modes: shape the sounds bus for whoever is listening.

The codec bench (soundboard.codecsim) measured what voice chat does to what
we send. Every engine captures its mic in mono and high-passes it: Discord at
~94 Hz, Vivox at ~80 Hz with a slow tail to ~150 Hz, WebRTC's cleanup (Epic
Online Services, browsers) around 80 Hz, Opus' own voice mode on top. Steam
voice and Photon are fed 24 kHz so nothing above 12 kHz survives; Unreal's
built-in voice and Vivox's low-CPU codec stop at 8 kHz. 100 Hz to 6 kHz gets
through everywhere.

A mode pre-shapes the sounds bus for that pipeline:

  bass     sub-bass harmonics: the part under 100 Hz the chat will drop is
           saturated and its 2nd..4th harmonics (100-350 Hz, which survive) are
           mixed back in, so a kick still reads as a kick on the other side. The
           saturation runs on the band divided by its own envelope, so the
           harmonics keep the same character at any level
  lowcut   remove the sub-bass ourselves, after the harmonics are made: the chat
           throws it away anyway, but until then it sets the peaks, and the limiter
           turns the whole song down for bass nobody will hear (an 808 track lost
           11 dB that way in a real Valorant party). Each sound is also given back
           the level the cut takes from it (Voice.makeup, from cut_shares when it
           starts): levelling measured it *with* its sub-bass, so a bass-heavy song
           was levelled 8-10 dB quieter than the others and then lost its bass too
  ceiling  low-pass at the codec's ceiling: the encoder stops spending bits on
           content nobody will hear, and what you monitor matches what they get
  comp     gentle RMS compressor, for custom modes. None of the engines wants it:
           it cost 2-5 dB and added distortion in every one, even behind an automatic
           gain, and pushed songs under a voice gate where the make-up kept them over
  mono     one channel, the way the mic capture will send it, with the
           phase-aware downmix (soundboard.sendfx.SmartMono) so stereo effects
           that would cancel in a plain average don't

Built-in modes are one per voice chat engine; custom ones (Settings) let you
describe any other codec by the same knobs. The engine runs one Processor per
output (it keeps filter state), all reading the same Dest.
