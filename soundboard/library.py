"""Sound library: decoding, loudness analysis, the decoded-audio cache and config.

Audio in memory is int16 stereo at SR ((n, 2), the engine scales it on the fly).
That is half the RAM of float32 and it round-trips losslessly through the cache
folder, so after the first run a sound loads by reading one file instead of
decoding and resampling it again.
