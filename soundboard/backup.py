"""Export and import: your board (sounds, their settings, categories and, if you like,
the app's settings) as one plain .zip, to move to a new PC or share.

The format is meant to be easy to read, write and pick apart by hand or by other
tools (docs/BACKUP-FORMAT.md has the full description):

    onionboard.json                 what's inside: format, version, categories, pad order
    settings.json                   optional: the app's settings (no devices, no opt-ins)
    sounds/001 Airhorn/sound.json   one folder per sound: its name, volume, hotkey,
    sounds/001 Airhorn/Airhorn.mp3    effects, categories… plus the audio file as it was
    sounds/001 Airhorn/picture.jpg    imported and its pad picture

Every sound folder stands on its own: a zip (or a plain folder) holding just one
`sound.json` and its audio imports as a single sound, and a zip of several sound
folders with no `onionboard.json` is a sound pack. Nothing in the archive is ever
used as a path: files are found by the names the JSON gives and written under new
names of our own, with a limit on each file and on the whole import (checked against
the free space first), so a crafted archive can't write elsewhere or fill the disk.
