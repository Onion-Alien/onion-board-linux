"""Radio tab back end: the station directory, the stream player and the globe page.

Stations come from Radio Browser (https://www.radio-browser.info), a free,
community-run open directory of ~60 000 internet radio stations with an open API
and no key. Most stations carry a latitude / longitude, which the globe uses.
The app asks it for: the most-listened stations that have a location (the globe,
cached for a day in radio_dir()), searches you type, and a "click" when you
start a station (the directory's own popularity count, which it asks clients to
send; Settings > Privacy turns it off). Nothing else about you is sent. With Radio
switched off in Settings > Privacy & security none of it goes online (FEATURE): the
tab shows an "off" panel instead and the relay refuses the directory and the streams.

The player is Qt Multimedia (FFmpeg): it opens the stream (MP3, AAC, Ogg, HLS…)
and decodes it, but never plays it itself. A QAudioBufferOutput hands the decoded
audio to the UI thread as 48 kHz stereo float, which goes into the engine
(`Engine.feed_radio`) like the Browser tab's audio, so it can go out through
your mic.

The globe is globe.gl (MIT licence, three.js) in a web view. It, the Earth pictures
and the country outlines ship with the app (ASSET_DIR), so opening either map
contacts nobody: no CDN learns who opened the Radio tab. The page is ours;
station names from the directory are escaped before they're shown, the page
can't navigate anywhere, and it reports clicks back over QWebChannel.
