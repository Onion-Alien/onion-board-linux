"""Errors in plain words, and problems reported to us — not to the libraries we use.

The app leans on other people's code (yt-dlp, libsndfile, PortAudio, Windows…), and
their error messages are written for programmers: `[youtube] dQw4…: Sign in to
confirm your age. Use --cookies-from-browser…`, `Error opening 'x.mp3': Format not
recognised.`, or yt-dlp's own "please report this issue on github.com/yt-dlp/…".
A user shouldn't be sent to report our app's problems to another project, or be
told about command-line options they don't have.

`describe(e)` turns any exception (or an error string) into a `Problem`: a short
sentence to show, the original message (personal paths scrubbed) for a report, and
whether it's worth reporting — things the user can't fix themselves, like a
downloader hiccup or a bug, as opposed to a private video or a full disk.
`report_url()` / `report_link()` / `warn()` offer such a problem as a pre-filled
issue on this app's own GitHub; nothing is ever sent by the app itself.
