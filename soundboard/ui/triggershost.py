"""Onion Board as the host of the Onion Watch add-on's Triggers tab: the one
interface the add-on talks to (onionwatch.host.Host, version TRIGGERS_API). It
hands the add-on the board's sounds, plays them through the board, keeps the
triggers in Config.screen and their pictures in %APPDATA%\\OnionBoard\\triggers
(as the built-in Triggers tab did, so nothing moves), and gives it the theme's
colours.

A trigger's sound plays like pressing its pad (into what others hear, whichever way
it's sent, with the pad's volume and mode). A ringing trigger ("Ring until stopped") loops its sound
until it's stopped, under its own voice id (`<sound>:ring:<trigger>`), in your
headphones when they're open (an alarm left ringing while you're away shouldn't
go out to everyone in the call), else wherever the board plays.

Every sound is played with a tag, and stop_tag(tag) stops it again: a ring, a
sound clicked on a trigger's card to check it (tags starting "hear:", played to
you alone like a pad's preview, as `<sound>:hear:<tag>`), or a pad-like one-shot
(the pads it pressed are remembered by tag). Removing a sound from a trigger, or
the trigger, then stops what it was playing.
