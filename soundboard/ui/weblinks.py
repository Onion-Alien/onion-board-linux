"""Web links open in the user's browser without the app's relay settings.

The app points FFmpeg at its relay through http_proxy & co. in its own environment
(net._set_env). A program the app starts gets a copy of that environment, so a
browser that wasn't running yet when a link was clicked would take the relay as its
proxy for everything, and every site would ask for the relay's login. Every
QDesktopServices.openUrl() for http(s)/mailto comes here instead: the opener is started
with net.own_env(), the user's own proxy variables, so the browser starts as if the
user had opened it.
