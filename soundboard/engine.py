"""Real-time audio engine.

Three WASAPI streams, each opened at its device's *native* rate (Windows'
built-in resampler, auto_convert, audibly garbles audio — measured ~70% junk on
VB-Cable — so all rate conversion is done here with soxr instead):

  mic  (input)  -> streaming resampler -> ring buffers -> main / monitor
  radio   (48 kHz, pushed from the UI thread) -> resampler -> ring buffers -> main / monitor
  aux     (48 kHz, pushed from a capture thread: one per captured program, Apps tab)
          -> the same path again, each with its own rings, volume and switches
  main (output) = sounds + radio / programs (when live) + mic -> the send device: a virtual
                  cable or any other output you picked (what others hear)
  mon  (output) = sounds + radio / programs [+ mic in test mode] -> your headphones
  obs  (output, optional) = sounds + radio / programs (when live) [+ mic] -> a device
       OBS captures: what others get, without the voice chat shaping, as its own track

Sounds are stored at SR and resampled (cached) to each output's rate. Every
playing Voice keeps its own position per output, so the two output devices
run on independent clocks without drift or glitches.

Live speed / pitch (the ⏩ controls): sounds play at `sound_speed` by reading
their data at a fractional rate (like a tape), and a pitch shifter on the sounds
bus corrects the pitch back (`sound_keep_pitch`) and adds `sound_pitch`. The
app's own playback (test recording, cue beeps, the setup tune, previews) is
`fixed`: played at speed 1 and mixed in after the pitch shifter. The live
effects (`sound_fx`: bass, reverb, echo… soundboard.livefx) come after the pitch.
Per-sound effects are baked in ahead of time instead (soundboard.soundfx).
