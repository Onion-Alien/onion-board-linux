"""The anonymous usage count: how many people use Onion Board, and which versions.

Once a day the installed app sends one "still here" to the project's GoatCounter
(a privacy-friendly counter): the version number and a random ID made on this PC, so
the same person isn't counted twice. Also a one-off "first start" (with where they
heard about the app, if they picked it on the installer's last page), and "updated" when
*Update now* installs a new version. With the daily one: which tabs were opened since the
last one (their names only). Soon after a start: how many problems there were since the
last send, as counts, never the report itself: a crash report or a freeze saved
(`crash/<version>`, `error/<version>`, `freeze/<version>`, with the error's type and
the file and line of this app's own code it happened in, e.g. `error/1.9.8/KeyError@
soundboard/engine.py:1090`: never its message or anything else from the report), or
the last run ending without the app closing itself (`unclean-exit/<version>/<why>`:
a hard crash, ended in Task Manager, a power cut; exitwatch.py works out which, on
this PC). And `uninstall/<version>` when the uninstaller removes it.
Nothing else: no name, sounds, settings, devices, games or IP address in the message
(GoatCounter sees the connection's address like any site does, and isn't sent it to
keep or look up).

On unless switched off: the installer's "Count me in" box, or Settings > Privacy &
security > Usage count (soundboard.net, so it also obeys Offline mode, a proxy and
Tor). Copies from before it existed start with it off: they were installed as an app
that sent nothing. A copy running from source never sends anything, and neither does
one on a PC with ONIONBOARD_NO_STATS set (the developer's own PCs and test VMs:
GoatCounter's "Ignore IPs" can't catch these sends, as they carry no IP)."""
